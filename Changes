* Beta testing releases:

** Release 2: xx June, 2011
*** Athena
  * Fixed some language issues in the Files menu
  * Fixed several bugs surrounding the bkg_fixstep Data attribute and
    made its behavior in relation to editing the normalization,
    pre-edge, and edge step text entry boxes more sensible
  * Added wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER style to text entry boxes on the main
    page and in the plot options area.  This allows replotting upon
    hitting return with focus in a text box.

*** Artemis
  * Completely rewrote mechanism for importing old-style Artemis
    project files, which now works much more reliably.
  * Feff object's rdinp method now recognizes a Feff8 input file.
    This is mostly used by Artemis to refuse to import such a thing as
    Feff8 is not yet supported in Demeter

*** Demeter
  * Changes to selection of the plotting backend just prior to R1
    broke most of the tests.  Both the selection mechanism and all the
    tests were fixed.

** Release 1: 10 June, 2011
 Initial beta testing release
