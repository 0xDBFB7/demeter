** Release 2: xx June, 2011
*** Athena
   - Fixed some language issues in the Files menu
   - Fixed several bugs surrounding the bkg_fixstep Data attribute and
     made its behavior in relation to editing the normalization,
     pre-edge, and edge step text entry boxes more sensible
   - Added wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER style to all text entry boxes.  This
     allows replotting or other actions (or none at all) upon hitting
     return with focus in a text box.  This is in response to a
     complaint that hitting enter in a text box caused focus to shift
     unexpectedly and to a request for more functionality.
   - Rewrote the quad plot
   - Clarified language used in stack tab of plotting options section
   - Fix a problem doing LCF fits with the final weight being negative
     when weights constrained to be non-negative and to sum to one.
   - Escape underscores in gnuplot plot legend for LCF plots
   - Fixed a bug using a background removal standard
   - Athena now reads chi(k) data files correctly
   - Group list:
       - Control-drag to rearrange groups in group list
       - Ctrl-j/Ctrl-k to change focus up and down in the groups list
       - Alt-j/Alt-k to move groups up and down in the groups list
   - Work around spurious error message when plucking from Gnuplot on
     Windows
   - Multiple plotting terminals with Gnuplot

*** Artemis
   - Completely rewrote mechanism for importing old-style Artemis
     project files, which now works much more reliably.
   - Feff object's rdinp method now recognizes a Feff8 input file.
     This is mostly used by Artemis to refuse to import such a thing as
     Feff8 is not yet supported in Demeter
   - Implemented Rk plot and made a button for it
   - Added wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER style to all one-line text entry boxes.

*** Demeter
   - Changes to selection of the plotting backend just prior to R1
     broke most of the tests.  Both the selection mechanism and all the
     tests were fixed.

*** Windows Installer
   - Renamed desktop icons so as to not overwrite Horae's icons
   - All bat file launchers save STDOUT and STDERR from the current
     session to a log file in %APPDATA%\demeter\
