* things that need doing
  
** Moose issues

** wx issues
  - [ ] why does Wx::FileDialog with ~wxFD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT~ style not work correctly?
        see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631908 and 
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/558674 for more info
        Turns out this is a gtk problem -- I can make the same thing happen with Firefox!

** installation issues [1/2]
  - [X] Relocation needs testing on Windows, need to make sure that
        the executables can all be found,
  - [ ] also need to be able to find all of Ifeffit CL and CAPS files.

** Demeter bugs, shortcomings, missing features  [1/20] [5%]
  - [ ] in =Demeter::Data::IO::save_many=, why doesn't updating in n specifying "background" not work to bring data up to date?  (fft, i.e. doing autobk, does work)
  - [ ] +serialize VPath+, put VPath into +dpj and+ fpj files
  - [ ] tie multiple groups together (e.g. MED data with reference)
  - [ ] add a record to an existing Athena project file
  - [ ] set E0 to peak of white line
  - [ ] clnorm + Julia and Jingen's MBACK replacement
  - [ ] Data object should note that datatype is xanes and not compute fbkg since the bkg array does not exist
  - [ ] cannot specify title for stddev and variance plots
  - [ ] Demeter command backend needs lots of polishing
  - [ ] 3rd derivative
  - [ ] SDK: better documentation for freeze/thaw//serialize/deserialize
  - [ ] error check deserialization for all objects, verify that it is a yaml or whatnot, return 0 if not
  - [ ] OpenBabel interface, tied into Feff
  - [ ] MRU lists and unicode, unicode-y file paths fail the -e test at Demeter::MRU line 77
  - [ ] need to disable indicators during the Rk plot.  Indicators (as
	    implemented) are not consistent with multiplot
  - [ ] Feff8 integration
  - [ ] Use PDL in pathfinder
  - [ ] Add tests to Path ranking framework (Karine Provost's idea, implemented in Demeter)
  - [X] Plucking from gnuplot really sucks
  - [ ] background groups for AXAFS

*** needs doing [2/14] [14%]
   - [ ] beter error handling in plugins -- specifically need to do a
         better job of trapping errors in the ~fix~ method.  Perhaps
         ~fix~ should always be called within an ~eval~?
   - [ ] report to a text dialog on values of a particular parameter for all/marked groups
   - [ ] implement megamerge
   - [ ] links to documentation on each tool
   - [-] *Main window* [2/3] [66%]
       + [X] +SpinCtrl for use with Rbkg+, event handler triggered twice on first use (found work-around)
       + [ ] SpinCtrl for use with bkg_spl1/2 (I find this to be a much worse idea)
       + [X] push bkg_e0 /algorithm/ onto marked/all groups and recalculate
   - [ ] *Convolve/noise tool*
       + add noise to chi data
   - [ ] *Difference tool* [0/1]
       + [ ] difference in k
   - [ ] *LCF tool* [0/3]
       + [ ] persistance of LCF results
       + [ ] satisfying both inclusive and unity can be trouble for
             poorly normalized data and/or poor standard selection
             (see email from Jack Hitch)
       + [ ] compute R-factor in k or R using fit from energy.  (see
             mail from Scott 7 January 2012)
   - [ ] *PCA tool* [0/10]
       + [ ] manual entry of component coefficients (??)
       + [ ] cluster analysis, select two components and plot the
             associations of each data with those two in a scatter plot.
       + [ ] persistance
       + [ ] worry about "def group.tt" line being to long in tt template
       + [ ] plotting in pgplot
       + [ ] error analysis, RET, SPOIL, etc, determination of number
             of components, validity of TT, etc
       + [ ] specialized file headers for reconstruction and tt save files
       + [ ] save eigenvectors to a file
       + [ ] pluck buttons for analysis range don't work
       + [ ] if the marked groups are changed after performing the PCA
             but before reconstructing data, the plot will fail with
             and exception.  need to save the list of data that went
             into the PCA and check against that rather than the
             current list of marked groups
   - [-] *Peakfit tool* [7/18]
       + [ ] implement pseudovoight
       + [ ] verify that all centroids are within (or near) fit range
       + [ ] verify that fit is sensible (ndata vs nparam)
       + [ ] +make group from fitted function+
       + [ ] behavior when changing data
       + [ ] pluck fit ranges
       + [ ] ndata is full data range rather than fit range with Fityk backend
       + [ ] broken using XES
       + [ ] explicitly set title of plot
       + [ ] sequence over marked groups
       + [ ] persistance
   - *Data watcher*
   - [ ] *Plot menu*
       + zoom/unzoom/cursor for pgplot
   - [-] *Help menu* [1/3]
       + [ ] demos
       + [ ] document
   - *metadata*

*** TODO 
** raw data and plugins
   - Need to expand the filetype system by examining data from *all* the XAS beamlines in the world.  Yes ... all of them.
   - solicit help from the facility representatives

** Windows issues [7/14] [50%]
  - [X] parameter group context menus don't get posted (see
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.wxperl.users/2011/03/msg7929.html)
  - [ ] the frickin' Gnuplot error logs seem to remain open and locked
	on Windows when a crash happens
  - [ ] status bar does not get color for wait or error messages
	/this may be unfixable, see/
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.wxperl.users/2011/04/msg7943.html
  - [ ] The atoms panel background color is too light.  Which window
	needs its BackgroundColour set to wxNullColour?
  - [ ] clampbox does not get enabled/disabled explicitly, is this
	another aspect of StaticBox that is different on Windows? (see
	link above)
  - [ ] relocation of Strawberry leaves Ifeffit unable to find phase
	shift and CL tables (use an ENV variable?)
  - [X] The Strawberry+Demeter package does not coexist at all with
        ActivePerl.  Best solution is to generate ppd for Demeter
        armed with all dependencies.  Would need to compile wrapper
        and somehow get gnuplot on the machine. *Solved by explicitly
        calling Strawberry in the .bat files*
  - [ ] Need to test that paths with (parens|commas|quotes) get
	followed correctly in all situations
  - [ ] Initial initialization of gnuplot and feff executable
        locations in the situation where the package has been moved or
        reinstalled such that and old demeter.ini still exists


** Artemis
*** Artemis bugs and missing features [0/6]  [0%]
   - [ ] Reorganize lists, move individual items up and down, move
	 blocks up and down, Path list, +Plot list+
   - [ ] do SSPaths get serialized and deserialized with the pointers
         to the feff calculation set correctly and no additional
         folders being created in stash (as was the case for FSPath)?
   - [ ] implementing derivative of phase plotting would require
         proper handling of this signal in the bkg, residual, and
         running R-factor plots.  Also probably want to disallow it
         for R123 plots.
   - [ ] better way of moving an empirical standard from Athena to
         Artemis -- should be able to import it directly from the
         athena project file.
   - [ ] Eric says: "if u use the automatic choice of parameters for
         the paths, in combination with a few quick first shell models
         and an imported feff.inp the whole thing runs in trouble. I
         don't really expect name collisions, but it seems to loose
         track between all the feff runs."  /This is a bit unclear.../
   - [ ] Path drag and drop [0/3]
        - [ ] DND of an SSPath does not work correctly
        - [ ] DND of FPath also broken
        - [ ] DND of selection (currently only one at a time)

**** Project [0/4]
   - [ ] VPaths to/from project file
   - [ ] SSPaths not saved/restored properly
   - [ ] Indicators to/from project file
   - [ ] GDS objects get created with same groupname over and over as
	 they are used in fits in the history

**** Advanced fitting
***** MFC [0/1]
   - [ ] Balance interstitial energies for MFC fits
***** MDS & Fit Sequence [1/3]
   - [ ] Import mutiple data sets from an Athena project file
   - [ ] feffit.inp import: needs testing; MDS that is not merely MKW
   - [-] Clone data sets such that the path list gets replicated efficiently (i.e. for MDS fits)


*** Histograms [12/14] [85%]
   - [X] Triangle object
     - yields a DS path and a TS path
     - by R and theta
     - +by a trio of Cartesian coordinates+
   - [ ] triangle histogram
   - [-] *Error checking* in Artemis, e.g. check that there is at least one bin in the supplied range(s)
	 - [X] SS
	 - [ ] ncl
	 - [ ] thru

** Hephaestus
  More standards!!

** Other object types [0/3]
  - [ ] Structural Units
      + Extension of VPath.  
      + Store GDS, feff, and path objects in a zip file.
      + On import, mark GDS parameters as merge if in conflict
  - [ ] MSPaths
      + Much like SSPath, make an arbitrary n-legged path
  - [ ] Nearly collinear paths
      + Define a three body configuration, generate its 4-legged path and a sequence of three-legged paths along with a mixing parameter.
      + It will take a single set of path parameters that are pushed onto the generated Path objects, except for the amplitude, which will be computed from the mixing parameter.
      + This is a single object for the user to interact with which expands into 2 or 3 3-legged paths and a single 4-legged path
      
      
* Atoms and Feff

** CIF [0/3] [0%]
  - [ ] CIF issue: CIF file with "_eof" token at end of file, as in [[file:notes/H16PW12O46.cif][this cif file]]
  - [ ] Handle CIF import problems more gracefully (See Shelly's other email from 17 June 2011)
  - [ ] CIF errors are not handled gracefully (e.g. multiple occupancy)

** Atoms [3/6] [50%]
  - [ ] 2 sites at the same position with occupancies <1.  see file above for an example
  - [ ] George Sterbinsky's recent mailing list post that turned out to be about 
	atoms' sphere and rhomboid in a non-orthogonal group
  - [ ] very confusing error message when core is not a tag
  - [X] Shell tags in the feff.inp ATOMS list
  - [X] Rhombic groups seem not be handled properly.  This example fails to generate a subshell of 3 atoms at ~1.9A
         : title name:     Fe2O3  hematite
         : space  R -3 c
         : a    = 5.0380	b    = 5.0380	c    = 13.7720
         : rmax = 6.00	core = Fe1
         : atom
         :   Fe     0.00000   0.00000   0.35530  Fe1
         :   O      0.30590   0.00000   0.25000  O1
  - [X] This input data fails
         : title formula:  LaCoO3
         : title refer1:  PRB V. 66 P. 094408 (2002)
         : title notes:   T = 300 K
         : space  r -3 c
         : a = 5.44864       c = 13.1035
         : rmax = 6.00       core = Co1
         : atom
         :   Co     0.00000   0.00000   0.00000  Co1
         :   La     0.00000   0.00000   0.25000  La1
         :   O      0.55032   0.00000   0.25000  O1


** Feff

*** To Do

 + +Need a useful error message in case where potph, for some reason, does not generate the ~phase.bin~ file.  It shoudl also *not* go ahead and do the pathfinder in that case.+

*** Feff8 is unsupported except as an Atoms output type

*** Five and six legged paths
[[file:examples/h12213.cif][This CIF file]] is an example of a structure that has five and six
legged nearly collinear scattering paths at around 4 Angstroms.  It
has metal atoms bridged by cyanide (CN), like Prussian Blue (see for
instance [[http://dx.DOI.org/10.1021/ic50177a008]])


* Ifeffit

In file ~src/lib/iff_show.f~, change line 431 from 

:     character*(*) s, t , messg*256

to

:     character*(*) s, t , messg*1024

Also need to specify locations of CL data and phase shift tables via
an ENV variable

* Weird stuff I'd prefer not to implement unless demanded
 1. xfit output (only used by women who glow and men who plunder)
 2. csv and text report (excel *is* implemented)
 3. point finder (this was Shelly's request)
 4. session defaults (did anyone but me actually use these?)
 5. set to standard (i.e. the one that is marked) -- confusing and
    little used
 6. tie relative energy value to changes in E0 (this was something
    Jeremy requested originally)
 7. set e0 by algorithm for all and marked -- also confusing and
    little used
 8. +plot margin lines for deglitching, deglitch many points (this was something that was most useful for a timing problem at 10ID that no longer exists)+
    (implemented)
 9. preprocessing truncation and deglitching (truncation might be
    worth implementing)
