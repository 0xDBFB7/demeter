* things that need doing

** wx issues
  - [ ] why does Wx::FileDialog with ~wxFD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT~ style not work correctly?
        see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631908 and 
        https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/558674 for more info
        Turns out this is a gtk problem -- I can make the same thing happen with Firefox!

** installation issues [/]

** Demeter bugs, shortcomings, missing features  [2/17] [11%]
  - [ ] in =Demeter::Data::IO::save_many=, why doesn't updating in n specifying "background" not work to bring data up to date?  (fft, i.e. doing autobk, does work)
  - [ ] Importing a Windows shortcut from a network mounted folder on linux or Mac will fail
  - [ ] +serialize VPath+, put VPath into +dpj and+ fpj files
  - [ ] tie multiple groups together (e.g. MED data with reference)
  - [ ] add a record to an existing Athena project file
  - [ ] set E0 to peak of white line
  - [ ] clnorm + Julia and Jingen's MXAN replacement
  - [ ] Data object should note that datatype is xanes and not compute fbkg since the bkg array does not exist
  - [ ] cannot specify title for stddev and variance plots
  - [ ] Demeter command backend needs lots of polishing
  - [X] we seem not to have a normalized group (i.e. plot the same as mu or norm)
  - [ ] 3rd derivative
  - [ ] SDK: better documentation for freeze/thaw//serialize/deserialize
  - [ ] error check deserialization for all objects, verify that it is a yaml or whatnot, return 0 if not
  - [ ] per data set R-factors, computed correctly for mkw fits (what is "correctly?")
  - [ ] OpenBabel interface, tied into Feff
  - [X] better detection of chi ascii data in case of 
        =$data = Demeter::Data->new(file=>"foo.chi");=

** raw data and plugins
   - Need to expand the filetype system by examining data from *all* the XAS beamlines in the world.  Yes ... all of them.
   - solicit help from the facility representatives

** Windows issues [4/10] [40%] 					    :Windows:
  - [X] parameter group context menus don't get posted (see
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.wxperl.users/2011/03/msg7929.html)
  - [X] +spurious message from clipboard+ (worked around)
  - [X] fpj file on Win seems to not get unpacked correctly /is this true?/	:Project:
  - [ ] the frickin' Gnuplot error logs seem to remain open and locked
	on Windows when a crash happens
  - [ ] status bar does not get color for wait or error messages
	/this may be unfixable, see/
	http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.wxperl.users/2011/04/msg7943.html
  - [ ] The atoms panel background color is too light.  Which window
	needs its BackgroundColour set to wxNullColour?
  - [ ] clampbox does not get enabled/disabled explicitly, is this
	another aspect of StaticBox that is different on Windows? (see
	link above)
  - [ ] relocation of Strawberry leaves Ifeffit unable to find phase
	shift and CL tables (use an ENV variable?)
  - [X] +using gnuplot on Win XP Home Edition failed due to the redirection of STDERR to ~$self->{__error_log}~ in Graphics::GnuplotIF.+
	removing this redirection fixed the
        problem, but I don't understand why it was a problem in the
        first place.
  - [ ] The Strawberry+Demeter package does not coexist at all with
        ActivePerl.  Best solution is to generate ppd for Demeter
        armed with all dependencies.  Would need to compile wrapper
        and somehow get gnuplot on the machine.


** Artemis
*** Artemis bugs and missing features [0/10]  [0%]
   - [ ] *rename Atoms/Feff*
   - [ ] Reorganize lists, move individual items up and down, move
	 blocks up and down, Path list, +Plot list+
   - [ ] discarding last page and returning to initial page has an
	 undefined value problem :HUH:
   - [ ] status messages in Atoms/Feff frame do not get posted in
	 Artemis status buffer
   - [ ] do SSPaths get serialized and deserialized with the pointers
         to the feff calculation set correctly and no additional
         folders being created in stash (as was the case for FSPath)?
   - [ ] per-data set R-factor reporting in log file is turned off.
	 see fit_parameter_report in Demeter::Data::I0
   - [ ] implementing derivative of phase plotting would require
         proper handling of this signal in the bkg, residual, and
         running R-factor plots.  Also probably want to disallow it
         for R123 plots.
   - [ ] better way of moving an empirical standard from Athena to
         Artemis -- should be able to import it directly from the
         athena project file.
   - [ ] Andreas Voegelin's idea about mixed Feff/empicial standards
   - [ ] Path drag and drop [0/3]
        - [ ] DND of an SSPath does not work correctly
        - [ ] DND of FPath also broken
        - [ ] DND of selection (currently only one at a time)

**** Project [2/5]
   - [ ] VPaths to/from project file
   - [ ] Indicators to/from project file
   - [X] Imported project file does not correctly set path-like tab
   - [X] replacing data in a project does not work
   - [ ] does autosave file work as intended?

**** Advanced fitting						   :Advanced:
***** MFC [0/1]
   - [ ] Balance interstitial energies for MFC fits
***** MDS & Fit Sequence [1/3]
   - [ ] Import mutiple data sets from an Athena project file
   - [ ] feffit.inp import: needs testing; MDS that is not merely MKW
   - [-] Clone data sets such that the path list gets replicated efficiently (i.e. for MDS fits)


*** Histograms [11/13] [84%]
   - [X] sum histogram bins into a single chi(k) file
   - [X] convert chi(k) data to a mock feffNNNN.dat file
   - [X] Triangle object
     - yields a DS path and a TS path
     - by R and theta
     - +by a trio of Cartesian coordinates+
   - [X] bin nealy colinear configurations by R and theta and sum into a single chi(k)
   - [X] turn SS histogram into a rattle TS histogram
   - [X] three-body histogram from X -- [+] -- X configurations
   - [X] error check numbers before making histograms in Artemis.  it is possible to have value like "3.3."
   - [X] ipot=1 is hardwired in many places -- generalize.... /fixed for SS, same should work for NCL and Thru/
   - [X] scatter plot of ncl distribution
   - [X] factor out DLPOLY dependence into a role so that other MD packages can be added more easily
   - [ ] triangle histogram
   - [-] *Error checking* in Artemis, e.g. check that there is at least one bin in the supplied range(s)
	 - [X] SS
	 - [ ] ncl
	 - [ ] thru
   - [X] Need flags for when to 
	 - [X] re-read the MD output file
	 - [X] re-parse the time steps
	 - [X] re-do the binning

** Hephaestus
  More standards!!

** Other object types [0/3]
  - [ ] Structural Units
      + Extension of VPath.  
      + Store GDS, feff, and path objects in a zip file.
      + On import, mark GDS parameters as merge if in conflict
  - [ ] MSPaths
      + Much like SSPath, make an arbitrary n-legged path
  - [ ] Nearly collinear paths
      + Define a three body configuration, generate its 4-legged path and a sequence of three-legged paths along with a mixing parameter.
      + It will take a single set of path parameters that are pushed onto the generated Path objects, except for the amplitude, which will be computed from the mixing parameter.
      + This is a single object for the user to interact with which expands into 2 or 3 3-legged paths and a single 4-legged path



** Windows							    :Windows:
*** DONE non-ascii symbols
*** DONE Fix [[file:lib/Demeter/UI/Wx/CheckListBook.pm][CheckListBook]]
      The solution is shown at the end of Athena.pm.  Define new methods for
      CheckBoxList which maintain an indexed list of groups rather than relying
      upon client data, which simply doesn't work on Windows.
      
 
* Atoms and Feff

** Atoms [2/8] [25%]
  - [ ] CIF issue: CIF file with "_eof" token at end of file, as in [[file:notes/H16PW12O46.cif][this cif file]]
  - [ ] Handle CIF import problems more gracefully (See Shelly's other email from 17 June)
  - [ ] 2 sites at the same position with occupancies <1.  see file above for an example
  - [ ] George Sterbinsky's recent mailing list post that turned out to be about 
	atoms' sphere and rhomboid in a non-orthogonal group
  - [ ] CIF errors are not handled gracefully (e.g. multiple occupancy)
  - [ ] Shell tags in the feff.inp ATOMS list
  - [X] Rhombic groups seem not be handled properly.  This example fails to generate a subshell of 3 atoms at ~1.9A
         : title name:     Fe2O3  hematite
         : space  R -3 c
         : a    = 5.0380	b    = 5.0380	c    = 13.7720

         :   O      0.55032   0.00000   0.25000  O1


** Feff

*** Feff8 is unsupported except as an Atoms output type

*** Five and six legged paths
[[file:examples/h12213.cif][This CIF file]] is an example of a structure that has five and six
legged nearly collinear scattering paths at around 4 Angstroms.  It
has metal atoms bridged by cyanide (CN).


* Weird stuff I'd prefer not to implement unless demanded
 1. xfit output (only used by women who glow and men who plunder)
 2. csv and text report (excel *is* implemented)
 3. point finder (this was Shelly's request)
 4. session defaults (did anyone but me actually use these?)
 5. set to standard (i.e. the one that is marked) -- confusing and
    little used
 6. tie relative energy value to changes in E0 (this was something
    Jeremy requested originally)
 7. set e0 by algorithm for all and marked -- also confusing and
    little used
 8. plot margin lines for deglitching, deglitch many points (this was
    something that was most useful for a timing problem at 10ID that
    no longer exists)
 9. preprocessing truncation and deglitching (truncation might be
    worth implementing)
