Note that the github pages branch of Demeter is generated from the
main source.

The sole exceptions are the index.html file and this file, which are
hand-written.

Chnages made to the content of the gh-pages branch **will** be
overwritten when the contents are regenerated.  Because of that, most
pull requests for the contents of this branch are not accepted.  The
sole exception would be a pull request suggesting changes to the
index.html file.
