* things that need doing

** wx issues
  - [ ] why does Wx::FileDialog with wxFD_OVERWRITE_PROMPT style not work correctly?
        see https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=631908 and 
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/558674 for more info
        Turns out this is a gtk problem -- I can make the same thing happen with Firefox!

** Demeter bugs and shortcomings  [0/11]
  - [ ] in D::Data::IO::save_many, why doesn't updating in n specifying
       	"background" not work to bring data up to date?  (fft, i.e. doing
       	autobk, does work)
  - [ ] +serialize VPath+, put VPath into +dpj and+ fpj files
  - [ ] tie multiple groups together
  - [ ] add a record to an existing Athena project file
  - [ ] set E0 to peak of white line
  - [ ] clnorm
  - [ ] Data object should note that datatype is xanes and not
        compute fbkg since the bkg array does not exist
  - [ ] cannot specify title for stddev and variance plots
  - [ ] Demeter command backend needs polishing
  - [ ] we seem not to have a normalized group (i.e. plot the same asmu and norm)
  - [ ] 3rd derivative


** Athena

*** Tools [16/23]
   - [X] main
   - [X] calibrate
   - [X] align
   - [X] deglitch

*** needs doing [2/13]
   - [X] deglitching crashes with gnuplot					:HUH:
   - [X] in project selection dialog, controls for entering a periodic
         subset (i.e. every Nth record starting with the Jth record)
         this would be useful for QXAS or dispersive data files with
         many measurements.  regexp matching against names would also
         be nice
   - [ ] implement frozen groups
   - [ ] replot upon group selection, space is configurable
	 (E, k, R, q, quad, k123, r123, i0/signal, none)
   - [ ] links to documentation on each tool
   - [ ] column selection dialog is not remembering data numerator and
         denominator selection
   - [ ] *Pluck buttons*
     + implement everywhere needed
     + figure out cause of spurious error on Windows "failed to get
       data from the clipboard error -2147221040 openClipboard failed"
   - [ ] *Convolve/noise tool*
     + add noise to chi data
   - [ ] *Difference tool*
     + plot diff for marked groups
     + plot areas from marked groups
     + make difference groups from marked groups
   - [ ] *LCF tool*
     + make data group from fit (use InsertData method)
     + marked groups automation, display in fourth tab, excel output
     + plot in R for fit in k
   - [ ] *Group list*
     + move groups up and down, keystroke | DnD
   - [ ] *Plot menu*
     + zoom/unzoom/cursor for pgplot
   - [ ] *Help menu*
     + demos
     + document
     + memory usage

*** Windows issues [0/3]
   - [ ] spurious message from clipboard
   - [ ] parameter group context menus don't get posted
   - [ ] the frickin' Gnuplot error logs seem to remain locked on Windows
	 when a crash happens


** Artemis
*** Artemis bugs and missing features [1/15]
   - [X] use text buffers as in Athena for TextEntryDialogs
   - [ ] import an FPath from a yaml or from a project file, pathlist
	 start page link for doing so
   - [ ] what is the purpose of regenerate in fit deserialization?  in
	 any case, need to fix group values *inside* yaml files
   - [ ] fit numbering is wrong,should not increment if previous fit has fitted=0
   - [ ] should I clear out unfitted fit folders from project upon import?
   - [ ] update pods for D::Feff::Histogram and D::Feff:DL_POLY
   - [ ] feffit.inp import: needs testing; MDS that is not merely MKW
   - [ ] rename Atoms/Feff
   - [ ] Balance interstitial energies for MFC fits		:MFC:
   - [ ] Import mutiple data sets from an Athena project	:MDS:FitSequence:
	 file 
   - [ ] Reorganize lists, move individual items up and down, move
	 blocks up and down, Path list, Plot list
   - [ ] Clone data sets such that the path list gets replicated
	 efficiently (i.e. for MDS fits)
   - [ ] VPaths to project file  				:Project:
   - [ ] Indicators to project file  				:Project:
   - [ ] Rename VPaths in VPath right click menu

*** Histograms [4/11]
   - [X] sum histogram bins into a single chi(k) file
   - [X] convert chi(k) data to a mock feffNNNN.dat file
   - [X] Triangle object
     - yields a DS path and a TS path
     - by R and theta
     - +by a trio of Cartesian coordinates+
   - [X] bin nealy colinear configurations by R and theta and sum into a single chi(k)
   - [ ] turn SS histogram into a rattle TS histogram
   - [ ] three-body histogram from X -- [+] -- X configurations
   - [ ] error check numbers before making histograms in Artemis.  it
	 is possible to have value like "3.3."
   - [ ] check that there is at least one bin in the supplied range(s)
   - [ ] ipot=1 is hardwired in many places -- generalize....
   - [ ] scatter plot of ncl distribution
   - [ ] factor out DLPOLY dependence into a role so that other MD
	 packages can be added more easily

** Other object types [0/3]
  - [ ] Structural Units
	Extension of VPath.  Store GDS, feff, and path objects in a zip file.
	On import, mark GDS parameters as merge if in conflict
  - [ ] MSPaths
	Much like SSPath, make an arbitrary n-legged path
  - [ ] Nearly collinear paths
	Define a three body configuration, generate its 4-legged path and a
	sequence of three-legged paths along with a mixing parameter.
	It will take a single set of path parameters that are pushed onto the
	generated Path objects, except for the amplitude, which will be
	computed from the mixing parameter.
	This is a single object for the user to interact with which expands
	into 2 or 3 3-legged paths and a single 4-legged path

** Windows
*** DONE non-ascii symbols
*** DONE Fix [[file:lib/Demeter/UI/Wx/CheckListBook.pm][CheckListBook]]
      The solution is shown at the end of Athena.pm.  Define new methods for
      CheckBoxList which maintain an indexed list of groups rather than relying
      upon client data, which simply doesn't work on Windows.


* Weird stuff I'd prefer not to implement unless demanded
 1. xfit output (only used by women who glow and men who plunder)
 2. csv and text report (excel *is* implemented)
 3. point finder (this was Shelly's request)
 4. session defaults (did anyone but me actually use these?)
 5. set to standard (i.e. the one that is marked) -- confusing and
    little used
 6. tie relative energy value to changes in E0 (this was something
    Jeremy requested originally)
 7. set e0 by algorithm for all and marked -- also confusing and
    little used
 8. plot margin lines for deglitching, deglitch many points (this was
    something that was most useful for a timing problem at 10ID that
    no longer exists)
 9. preprocessing truncation and deglitching (truncation might be
    worth implementing)
