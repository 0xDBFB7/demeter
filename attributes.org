* Athena's JSON-style project file

** Fields in JSON file

The project file is a serialized dictionary/hash/associative array.
Each entry has a key and a value.  The value is typically a dictionary
or a list.

There are several special fields that the JSON file must contain so
that Athena can properly process the file and preserve the order of
display of the data contained in the file.

Special fields all begin with 5 underscores.  That's a bit wacky, but
5 preceeding underscores is unlikely to carry special meaning in any
programming language, yet underscores are likely to be valid as parts
of variable or dictionary key names.

*** Headers

The first several lines should look something like this

:     {"_____emacs_mode": "-*- mode: json; truncate-lines: t -*-",
:      "_____header1": "# Athena project file -- Demeter version 0.9.21",
:      "_____header2": "# This file created at 2015-02-04T17:23:22",
:      "_____header3": "# Using Demeter 0.9.21 with perl 5.018002 and using Larch 0.9.24 on linux",

The ~_____emacs_mode~ line is a convenience for Bruce.  That will
cause the file to display in a helpful way in Emacs, which helps him
troubleshoot problems.  That line is not actually necessary, but Bruce
will be grateful if you includee it.

The ~_____headerN~ lines identify the file as an Athena project file,
identify the moment of creation, and identify the program that and
computing environment that did the creating.

The ~_____header1~ line is *necessary*.  That *must* appear in the
first four lines of the file or Athena/Artemis will not recognize the
file as a project file.  In fact, Demeter looks for this regexp in the
first four lines:

:      /_____header\d.+Athena project file/

The use of single or double quotes is not important.  The index in
~_____headerN~ is not important.  But one of the header fields *must*
contain ~Athena project file~ and *must* show up in the first four
line of the file.

The ~_____header2~ and ~_____header3~ lines are not strictly
necessary, but including them is good form and may help with
troubleshooting.

** Other fields

The *must* be a field called ~_____order~ which is a list of group
names in the order of display.  Because the decoded JSON file is a
dictionary/hash/associative array, the order of entries cannot be
guaranteed.  The Athena users expects to see the data in the same
order when a project file is re-opened.  ~_____order~, then, is used
to specify the order.

Here is an example from a project file with two data groups:

:  "_____order": ["ftaja","cyrlv"]


A field called ~_____journal~ is optional.  If provided, it is a list
of strings that together are user-supplied commentary on the project
file.  In the context of Athena, this is the content of the project
journal.

** Data fields

A data field has a key which is used as the Demeter group attribute,
the Ifeffit group name, and the Larch group name.  In the Larch
context, a data group might be defined like so:

:       abcde = read_ascii('mydata.dat')

while in the Ifeffit context

:       read_data(file= mydata.dat, type=raw, group=abcde)

In each case, "abcde" is the group name which should be used as the
key for the data field.

Each data field consists of a dictionary of attributes, and 2 or more
lists of numbers.

| subfield name | purpose                          | required |
|---------------+----------------------------------+----------|
| args          | attribute dictionary             | yes      |
| x             | ordinate array (energy or k)     | yes      |
| y             | abscissa array (mu(E) or chi(k)) | yes      |
| i0            | i0 array                         | no       |
| signal        | signal array                     | no       |
| stddev        | standard deviation array         | no       |
| xdi           | metadata dictionary              | no       |


Here's an example of a data field for a group named "ftaja".  (Athena
uses, but does not require, random 5-character strings as group
names.)

: "ftaja": {
:           "args": {"key1": "val1", ..., "keyN": "valN"}
:           "x": ["6911.98862","6916.99353", ...]
:           "y": ["0.044142489773191296","0.041334046117570016", ...]
:           "i0": ["41410.4","41396.4", ...]
:           "signal": ["39622.2","39720.2", ...]
: }

** Attributes

The following tables explain all the attributes found in a project
file written by Athena.  They are all listed here for the sake of
completeness and to document the contents of an Athena-written Athena
project file.

Every input parameter has a sensible default, thus any or all of these
can be skipped in a project file written outside of Athena.  Athena
will do the right thing with any that are missing.

For example, a project file can have only parameters related to
Autobk.  Those will be used by Athena and Athena's defaults will be
used elsewhere.
