The PODs have been nicely formatted for html and organized into a hierarchical structure that looks like a CPAN project page.\r\n\r\n* [Demeter Programming Guide](dpg/index.html): The DPG is a how-to guide written at a higher level than the programming documentation. It includes descriptions of how to use the main components of Demeter as well as several complete examples.\r\n\r\n* [Athena Users' Guide](http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/software/doc/Athena/html/): This is the manual for the older version of Athena. It has not yet been updated for the new, Demeter-based version. The new version is, however, sufficiently similar to the old that this is still useful for understanding how to use Athena effectively.\r\n\r\n* [Artemis Users' Guide](artug/index.html): This is the users' guide for the new version of Artemis. While it is unfinished, much of the text and many of the screenshots are in place. Keep checking back for updates.\r\n\r\n* [Artemis instruction videos](http://vimeo.com/channels/exafs): These are screencast videos demonstrating the use of the Artemis program for EXAFS data analysis.\r\n\r\n* [Lecture videos](http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Events/Past_events/XAS-workshop-2011.html?mgnlCK=1339516257183): In November 2011, I presented an XAS training course at the Diamond Light Source. All my lectures and software demonstrations were recorded along with the computer desktop. The Diamond technical staff did a great job assembling all of this material in streaming video.

You can also find all the data used in the presentations and in the various videos linked above. PDF files of presentations and a zip file containing all the example data can be found at the XAS Education downloads page\r\n\r\n* [Demeter Changes list](Changes.html): The changes file for Demeter, Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus. [This version](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/blob/master/Changes.org) might be slightly more up-to-date.\r\n\r\n* [Demeter To Do list](todo.html): Bruce's \"To Do\" list for Demeter, Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus. [This version](https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/blob/master/todo.org) might be slightly more up-to-date.\r\n\r\n* [Demeter installation instructions](http://bruceravel.github.com/demeter/pods/installation.pod.html)\r\n* [Hints for submitting a helpful bug report](http://bruceravel.github.com/demeter/pods/bugs.pod.html)\r\n* [Hints on how to ask questions on the Ifeffit mailing list](http://bruceravel.github.com/demeter/pods/help.pod.html)\r\n* [Suggestions for contributing to Demeter](http://bruceravel.github.com/demeter/pods/contribute.pod.html)\r\n* [Screenshots of the new Athena](http://cars9.uchicago.edu/~ravel/misc/Albums/demeter/)\r\n* [Screenshots of the new Hephaestus](http://cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit/Demeter/WxHephaestus)\r\n* [A quick overview of Athena's PCA tool](http://cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit/Demeter/AthenaPCA)\r\n\r\n","name":"Demeter","google":""}
