The Log and Journal windows
===========================


The Log window
--------------

After the fit completes and the result of the fit is plotted, the Log
window is displayed. The :button:`Log,light` button on the bottom
left of the Main window is used to display and hide this window.

   The Log window.


All of the details of the fit are recorded in the text displayed in
this window. Below the descriptive fitting properties displayed at the
top in blue text are the main fitting statistics, including |chi|\
:sup:`2`, |chi|\ :sup:`2`\ :sub:`Î½`, the R-factor, |epsilon| (k),
|epsilon| (R), and counts of the number of independent points and the
number of guess parameters. Those are followed by the details of `the
happiness evaluation <fit/happiness.html>`__. Two lines of the fitting
statistics are colored with the same color determined from the
happiness and used for the Fit button and the various plotting
buttons.

Following the statistical parameters are tables of the :guess:`guess`,
:def:`def`, :set:`set`, :restrain:`restraint`, and :after:`after`
parameters.  Error bars are given for the :guess:`guess` parameters.
Correlations between :guess:`guess` parameters follow.

Scrolling down in this, you find tables of evaluated path parameters
for each of the paths and each of the data sets.  Note that
unceretainties are **not** propagated through to the path parameters.
In the current version of :demeter:`artemis`, that chore is left for
the user.  :demeter:`larch` does do error propagation, so eventually
that will get implemented in :demeter:`artemis`.

The text in the log file is identical to the log text from the most
recent fit in `the History window <history.html>`__.

The buttons at the bottom of the Log window can be used to save the log
to a text file or to print its contents.


The Journal window
------------------

Clicking the :button:`Journal,light` button on the right side of the
Main window displays and hides the Journal window.  This is simply a
blank text box in which you can write notes about your fitting project
(or love letters) to your collaborators.  The text found in
this box will be saved to and restored from the project file.

The :button:`Save` button at the bottom of the Log window can be used
to save the journal to a text file.  You will be prompted for the name
of the file.
