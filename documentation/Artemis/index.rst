Artemis: EXAFS Data Analysis using Feff with Larch or Ifeffit
=============================================================

::

   I sing of Artemis, whose shafts are of gold, who cheers on the hounds, the pure maiden, shooter
   of stags, who delights in archery, own sister to Apollo with the golden sword. Over the shadowy
   hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow, rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous
   shafts. The tops of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes awesomely with the
   outcry of beasts: earthquakes and the sea also where fishes shoal. But the goddess with a bold
   heart turns every way destroying the race of wild beasts: and when she is satisfied and has
   cheered her heart, this huntress who delights in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the
   great house of her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi, there to order the
   lovely dance of the Muses and Graces.

                                                  Translated by H. G. Evelyn-White

:demeter:`artemis` is the goddess of the hunt, which is an apt
metaphor for the chore of data analysis. The name also suggests a
fallacious pun which works in English and in the Romance languages and
which suggests that EXAFS data analysis is more an art than a science.
