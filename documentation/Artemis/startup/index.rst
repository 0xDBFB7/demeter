Starting Artemis
================

The :demeter:`artemis` program is launched on Windows by
double-clicking the :demeter:`artemis` icon on the desk top, by
selecting :demeter:`artemis` from the :demeter:`demeter` menu in the
Start Menu, or by typing :command:`dartemis` (with a :button:`d`) at
the command prompt. If you installed :demeter:`demeter` using the
standard installer package, you can also double click on an
:demeter:`artemis` project file (i.e. one with a :file:`.fpj`
extension) to open it in :demeter:`artemis`.

On a unix computer, :demeter:`artemis` is launched by typing
:command:`dartemis` in the shell. Depending on how :demeter:`demeter`
was installed on your computer, there may be some kind of application
launcher, such as a desktop icon, a panel or dashboard launcher, or an
entry in some kind of application menu.

Once started, :demeter:`artemis` displays two windows, as shown below.

Everything will certainly look a little different on your computer. This
and all other screenshots in this document were taken on an Ubuntu Linux
computer running KDE with custom window decorations. Although the
details of the appearance may differ, all functionality is the same on
all platforms. (You may not have a cool insect as the background image.
Your loss.)

The window across the top of your screen is the :quoted:`Main
window`. It provides an overview of the state of the program and of
your fitting project. The window along the left side of the screen is
the :quoted:`Plot window`. It is used to control how certain plots of
your data, fits, paths, and other things are displayed.

The plot window can be hidden by clicking the :button:`Plot,light`
button on the left side of the main window. Clicking that button again
will make the plot window reappear in the same place on your screen.

The following two sections provide an overview of the functionality in
these two windows. We will return these many times throughout this
document.
