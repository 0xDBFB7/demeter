Worked examples
===============

This section presents some worked examples of EXAFS data analysis
using :demeter:`artemis`. These should give a sense of the work flow
of a typical analysis project.

**Iron pyrite**
    This is Bruce's favorite teaching example, FeS\ :sub:`2`. This is a
    cubic crystal, not too structurall complicated, but with enough
    interesting features to make it a good teaching tool. The data and
    crystal structure for this example `can be found
    here <https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/FeS2>`__.

**Methyltin**
    This demonstrates a multiple data set fit using Sn K edge data on
    dimethyl tin dichloride and monomethyl tin trichloride. The data and
    crystal structure for this example `can be found
    here <https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples/Methyltin>`__.
