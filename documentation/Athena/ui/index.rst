Athena's User Interface
=======================


:demeter:`athena` can be used successfully by using relatively few of
its capabilities. For instance, it's fairly obvious that you can
import data by opening a file using the File menu, change a parameter
value by editing the number in one of the little boxes in the main
window, or plot data by clicking one of the :kbd:`E,orange`,
:kbd:`k,orange`, :kbd:`R,orange`, or :kbd:`q,orange`, buttons.  There
is, however, a lot more to :demeter:`athena` at the level of its user
interface. Part of making the leap from beginner to expert is learning
about the various user interface features.
