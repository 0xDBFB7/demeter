User Interface
==============


:demeter:`athena` can be used successfully by using relatively few of
its capabilities. For instance, it's fairly obvious that you can
import data by opening a file using the :guilabel:`File` menu, change
a parameter value by editing the number in one of the little boxes in
the main window, or plot data by clicking one of the :button:`E,orange`,
:button:`k,orange`, :button:`R,orange`, or :button:`q,orange`, buttons.  There
is, however, a lot more to :demeter:`athena` at the level of its user
interface. Part of making the leap from beginner to expert is learning
about the various user interface features.
