Athena's User Interface
=======================


:demeter:`athena` can be used successfully by using relatively few of
its capabilities. For instance, it's fairly obvious that you can
import data by opening a file using the File menu, change a parameter
value by editing the number in one of the little boxes in the main
window, or plot data by clicking one of the buttons labeled with the
letters E, k, R, or q. There is, however, a lot more to
:demeter:`athena` at the level of its user interface. Part of making
the leap from beginner to expert is learning about the various user
interface features.
