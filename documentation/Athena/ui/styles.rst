Plot styles
===========


Plot styles are a mechanism for storing the contents of the plot options
tabs. For example, you can save plotting parameters good for viewing
XANES data and another set for viewing the full EXAFS spectrum. You can
save any number of sets of parameters. When you save a set of
parameters, you are prompted for a name. After that, you can select a
parameter set by name. These parameter sets are saved to disk, thus
persist between sessions.

You can discard a plot style by double clicking on it.
