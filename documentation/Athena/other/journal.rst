Project journal
===============


:demeter:`athena` provides a simple yet powerful way of documenting
your work. The project journal tool provides a blank text box in which
you can write whatever you want. The text from this box is saved to
`the project file <../output/project.html>`__. When a project file is
imported into :demeter:`athena`, any journal text will be restored to
this text box.

   The journal tool.

This is a good way to document your progress through a data processing
or analysis chore. It is also useful for documenting the nature of your
samples in a way that stays with the data. Finally, it is a way to
communicate with a collaborator or boss when exchanging data via a
project file.
