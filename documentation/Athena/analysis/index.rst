Data analysis in Athena
=======================

ATHENA provides various kinds of data analysis. None of the data
analysis capabilities in ATHENA require the use of FEFF. Analysis of
data using FEFF is a huge topic and is thepurpose of the ARTEMIS
program. The data analysis techniques included in ATHENA are all purely
empirical. While there is no substitute for careful, sophisticated
analysis of EXAFS data using theory from FEFF, often the empirical
techniques described in this chapter are adequate to answer the
questions you have about your data.

ATHENA's analysis tools are accessed from the Analysis menu, as shown
below.
