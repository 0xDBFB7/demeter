The Data window
===============

After importing data from an :demeter:`athena` project file, several
things happen:

#. A new Data window is created for interacting with that data set and
   the various controls are set to values taken from the
   :demeter:`athena` project file or from :demeter:`artemis`'
   defaults.

#. A message is written to the status bar in the Main window.

#. The data are plotted in k-space.

#. The data are transferred to the plotting list in the Plot window.

#. An entry is placed in the Data list on the main window.

Here is the Data window as it initially appears:

.. _fig-datawindow:
.. figure:: ../_images/datawindow.png
   :target: _images/datawindow.png
   :align: center

   The Data window, immediately after data import.

#. The |transfer button| button is used to transfer this data set into the plotting list
   in the `Plot window <plot/index.html>`__.

#. This is the `characteristic value <extended/cv.html>`__ of this data
   set. Typically, this is just incremented for each data set as it is
   imported. The CV can be used as a special parameter in math
   expressions.

#. This text box shows where this data set came from. Typically, this
   shows the fully resolved file name for an :demeter:`athena` project
   file, followed by the index of the data from that project file.

#. These five buttons generate special plots using this data set. Each
   of the special plots types is explained below. Like the Fit button
   from the main window, these buttons are recolored after a fit
   according to the value of the fit's `happiness
   parameter <fit/happiness.html>`__.

#. This text box contains any title lines associated with the data.

#. These controls are used to set the functional form of the windows for
   forward and backward Fourier transforms. The R\ :sub:`min` and
   R\ :sub:`max` values are also used as the fitting range. The menus
   for selecting the windows functions are only displayed when the
   :configparam:`Artemis,window_function` is set to :guilabel:`user`.

#. These check buttons are used to set the k-weight values used to
   evaluate the fit. Note that these are *check* buttons and *radio*
   buttons not |nd| more than one can be selected at a time. The
   default is that all of 1, 2, and 3 checked, resulting in a multiple
   k-weight fit. The default can be changed by editing the
   :configparam:`Fit,k1`, :configparam:`Fit,k2`, and
   :configparam:`Fit,k3` parameters.

#. This area contains several other parameters related to this data set.
   When the first check button is checked, this data will be included in
   the fitting model. Unchecking it is a way of removing a data set from
   a multiple data set fit without actually disposing of the data. The
   second check button instructs :demeter:`artemis` to automatically transfer this
   data set to the `plotting list <plot/index.html>`__ at the end of a
   fit. The third check button turns on background co-refinement. The Îµ
   text box allows you to specify a measurement error fit this data set.
   Finally, the last check button turns phase corrected plotting on and
   off. See `the discussion of phase corrected
   plots <path/plot.html#phasecorrectedplots>`__.

#. This status bar is used to display messages specifically related to
   this data set. These messages are logged in `the status
   buffer <./monitor.html#thestatusbuffer>`__.

#. The paths list will become populated as paths are associated with
   this data set. How that works will be explained in `the next
   chapter <path/index.html>`__.

#. When no paths have yet been associated with a data set, this
   default page is displayed. The lines of blue text are sensitive to
   :mark:`leftclick,.` mouse clicks and initiate the import of certain
   kinds of data. All of those import options will be explained
   elsewhere in this document.

After one or more paths have been associated with this data set, the
Data window looks something like this.

.. _fig-datawindowwithpaths:
.. figure:: ../_images/datawindow_withpaths.png
   :target: _images/datawindow_withpaths.png
   :align: center

   The Data window, with imported paths.

Note that the paths list is populated with the paths assigned to these
data and that the right hand side of the Data window displays the
details about a particular path.  :mark:`leftclick,..` Clicking on an
item in the paths list causes that path to be displayed on the right.

Note that each path in the path list has a check button associated with
it.  These check buttons are involved in much of the functionality
described below.

Some vocabulary: The highlighted path is displayed on the right and is
said to be :quoted:`selected`.  When a paths check button is checked,
it is said to be :quoted:`marked`.  In this example, the first path is
selected and no paths have yet been marked.


Special plots
-------------

The five plot buttons on the Data window make special plots of that data
set along with its fit (if a fit has been run). Each of these is an
elaborate, multi-component plot that cannot be made using the tools on
the Plot window. The examples shown here are for a fit to gold metal out
to the fourth coordination shell.


**The k123 plot**

   .. _fig-plotk123:
   .. figure:: ../_images/plot_k123.png
      :target: _images/plot_k123.png
      :align: center

      k123 plot

   This is the :quoted:`k123` plot. It shows the data and fit as |chi|
   (k). Each k-weighting from 1 to 3 is shown. The data with
   k-weighting of 2 is plotted normally. The other two k-weightings
   are scaled by the appropriate number such that all three
   k-weighting appear to be about the same size in the plot. The
   Fourier transform window function is drawn over the k-weight of 1
   spectrum.


**The R123 plot**

   .. _fig-plotR123:
   .. figure:: ../_images/plot_r123.png
      :target: _images/plot_r123.png
      :align: center

      R123 plot

   This is the :quoted:`R123` plot. It shows the data and fit as |chi|
   (R). The Fourier transform has been done with each k-weighting from
   1 to 3. The data with k-weighting of 2 is plotted normally. The
   other two k-weightings are scaled by the appropriate number such
   that all three k-weighting appear to be about the same size in the
   plot. The back-Fourier transform window function is drawn over the
   k-weight of 1 spectrum to indicate the range over which the fit was
   evaluated (assuming the fit space is R, as is the default). The
   radio button in the `Plot window <plot/index.html>`__ for selecting
   the part of |chi| (R) is respected when this plot is made.



**The Rmr plot**

   .. _fig-plotRmr:
   .. figure:: ../_images/plot_rmr.png
      :target: _images/plot_rmr.png
      :align: center

      Rmr plot

   The :quoted:`Rmr` plot is the plot displayed by default after a
   fit. It shows the magnitude and real part of |chi| (R) using the value
   of k-weighting selected in the Plot window. The back-Fourier transform
   window function is drawn over the magnitude spectrum to indicate the
   range over which the fit was evaluated (assuming the fit space is R,
   as is the default).


**The Rk plot**

   .. _fig-plotRk:
   .. figure:: ../_images/plot_rk.png
      :target: _images/plot_rk.png
      :align: center

      Rk plot

   The :quoted:`Rk` plot is a stacked plot with the :quoted:`Rmr` on
   the bottom and |chi| (k) on the top.  The value of k-weighting
   selected in the `Plot window <plot/index.html>`__ is used. Fourier
   transform windows are drawn over the |chi| (k) and \|\ |chi| (R)|
   spectra.
   
   This is Bruce's favorite way of presenting EXAFS data and fit for
   publication.  It is a compact representation of the data and the
   fit.  All the interesting ways of visualizing the data and fit are
   presented on equal footing.



**The kq plot**

   .. _fig-plotkq:
   .. figure:: ../_images/plot_kq.png
      :target: _images/plot_kq.png
      :align: center

      kq plot

   The :quoted:`kq` plot shows the data and fit as |chi| (k) and |chi|
   (q). The value of k-weighting selected in the `Plot window
   <plot/index.html>`__ is used.  The Fourier transform windows are
   drawn over the |chi| (k) spectra.


Data menu bar
-------------

The Data menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _fig-datadatamenu:
.. figure:: ../_images/data-datamenu.png
   :target: _images/data-datamenu.png
   :align: center

   This menu displays functions that can act on the data set displayed
   in that window.

**Rename**
    Change the name of this data set. This is the name displayed next to
    the transfer button, in the plotting list, in the log file, and in
    plot legends.
**Replace**
    Change the |chi| (k) by importing new data from an :demeter:`athena` project file.
    This is used to apply the current fitting model to a new data set.
**Discard**
    Throw away this data set and its window. Also remove this data set
    from the Data list in the Main window.
**Save data**
    Write this data set to a column data file. The |chi| (k) output option
    will write a file with columns for k, |chi| (k), k\ |chi| (k), k\ :sup:`2`\ |chi| (k),
    k\ :sup:`3`\ |chi| (k), and the window function. The |chi| (R) output option will write
    a file with columns for R, the real part, the imaginary part, the
    magnitude, the phase, and the window function. The |chi| (q) option is of
    the same form as the |chi| (R) option.
**Save data and fit**
    Write the data, the fit, and several other arrays to a data file in
    one of various forms of k, R, or q. This will have columns for the
    abscissa, the selected form of the data, and the corresponding forms
    of the fit, the background (if co-refined), the residual, the
    running R-factor, and the window.
**Save data and paths**
    This will save the data along with each marked path to a column data
    file. The columns will be the same as for the data+fit output.
**Other fitting standards**
    This submenu allows you to import a variety of special path types,
    including `quick first shell paths <extended/qfs.html>`__ and
    `empirical standards <extended/empirical.html>`__. *(Structural units
    have not yet been implemented)*
**Balance interstitial energies**
    *(This feature has not yet been implemented)*
**Set all degeneracies**
    These two options allow you to control the degeneracy values of all
    the paths in the fit. The choices are to set them all to 1 or to
    have them all use their degeneracies from their respective :demeter:`feff`
    calculations.
**Set window function**
    When the :configparam:`Artemis,window_function` parameter is not set to :guilabel:`user`,
    this submenu will be displayed. It allows the user to change the
    window function to be used for both forward and backward Fourier
    transforms. Note that setting the window function in this way uses
    the same functional form for transforms in both directions. If you
    want to control the two functions independently (for some
    inscrutable reason), you must set :configparam:`Artemis,window_function` to
    :guilabel:`user`.
**Export parameters**
    In a multiple data set fit, this allows you to constrain the data
    sets to have the same choice of Fourier transform parameters. *(This
    feature has not yet been implemented)*
**Set kmax to Ifeffit's suggestion**
    Use :demeter:`ifeffit`'s (or :demeter:`larch`'s) suggestion for an
    appropriate value of k\ :sub:`max`.
**Show epsilon**
    Show the value of |epsilon| computed from the noise in this data set. The
    value will be displayed in the Data window status bar.
**Show Nidp**
    Show the number of independent points computed from the Fourier
    transform and fitting range. The will be displayed in the Data
    window status bar.



The Path menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This menu displays various functions that can be applied to the
paths associated with this data set.

.. _fig-datapathmenu:
.. figure:: ../_images/data-pathmenu.png
   :target: _images/data-pathmenu.png
   :align: center

   The Paths menu.

**Transfer**
    Transfer the displayed path to the plotting list in the `Plot
    window <plot/index.html>`__.
**Rename**
    Change the name of the displayed path. This is the name displayed
    next to the transfer button, in the plotting list, in the log file,
    and in plot legends.
**Show**
    Post a dialog box with :demeter:`ifeffit`'s current evaluation of all path
    parameters for the displayed path.
**Save path**
    Write the displayed path to a column data file. The |chi| (k) output
    option will write a file with columns for k, |chi| (k), k |chi| (k), k\ :sup:`2`\ |chi| (k),
    k\ :sup:`3`\ |chi| (k), and the window function. The |chi| (R) output option will write
    a file with columns for R, the real part, the imaginary part, the
    magnitude, the phase, and the window function. The |chi| (q) option is of
    the same form as the |chi| (R) option.
**Clone**
    Make a copy of the displayed path and insert it into the path list.
    The degeneracies of the original and cloned path will be half the
    original degeneracy.
**Add path parameter**
    Post the dialog below, which is used to add a path parameter
    math expression to multiple paths associated with this or other data
    sets. This is a convenience allowing you to edit the path parameters
    for many paths at the same time.

    .. _fig-addparam:
    .. figure:: ../_images/addparam.png
       :target: _images/addparam.png
       :align: center

       Add parameter dialog

**Export path parameters**
    Push the math expressions of each path parameter from the displayed
    path to other paths. This submenu has options for pushing these
    values to the other paths from the same :demeter:`feff` calculation, to the
    marked paths, to all paths in this data set, or to all paths in all
    data sets.
**Quick 4 parameter fit**
    This is a convenience function for setting up a simple, one-shell
    fit. Selecting this menu item will create 4 parameters in the GDS
    window and use those four parameters as the math expressions for
    S\ :sup:`2`\ :sub:`0`, E\ :sub:`0`, |Delta| R, and
    |sigma|\ :sup:`2` for each path assigned to this data set. This is
    intended only for a one-path, one-shell fit. While it may be
    tempting to expect broader utility out of this function |nd| don't. It
    really only serves this narrow purpose.
**Discard**
    Discard the displayed path, removing its window, and removing it
    from the path list.


The Marks menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _fig-datamarksmenu:
.. figure:: ../_images/data-marksmenu.png
   :target: _images/data-marksmenu.png
   :align: center

   The Marks menu

Much of :demeter:`artemis`' functionality revolves around
groups of marked paths. This menu contains a number of shortcuts for
marking paths. Note that each of these has a keyboard shortcut given on
the right side of the menu. Learning the shortcuts for marking functions
that you use frequently is key to the effective use of :demeter:`artemis`.

Marking via these functions is cumulative. That is, most of them only
add to the set of marked paths. Choosing to mark, say, all single
scattering paths will not unmark any marked multiple scattering paths.

Several of these functions will post a dialog for receiving input.
Marking by regular expression (regex) will prompt for a perl-style
regular expression to match against the labels in the path list. The
pattern you provide will be used only if it can be successfully parsed
as a valid perl regular expression.

Marking either greater than or less than an A value will prompt for a
cutoff in path ranking.

Marking either greater than or less than an R value will prompt for that
R value.

Marking before or after the current path will mark those above or below
the displayed path in the path list. Included and excluded refers to
whether a path is selected as being included in a fit.


.. caution:: When using regular expression marking, you have access to
   perl's entire regular expression functionality. If you know what a
   :regexp:`(?{ code })` extended expression is and you use it
   foolishly, you only have yourself to blame.


The Actions menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _fig-dataactionsmenu:
.. figure:: ../_images/data-actionsmenu.png
   :target: _images/data-actionsmenu.png
   :align: center

   The Actions menu.


Every item in this menu operates either on the set of included paths
or the set of marked paths. Again, keyboard shortcuts are given in the
menu.

The first two options will make `a VPath <plot/vpaths.html>`__ out of
either all the paths for this data set or the marked paths. The VPath
will be placed in the plotting list in the `Plot
window <plot/index.html>`__ and a plot will be made in R. The option to
make the sum of all paths is particularly useful for comparing the
fittingmodel to the data without actually running the fit.

The next two options will transfer paths to the plotting list, then make
a plot in R.

The next two options will cause the set of marked paths to be included
in or excluded from the fit. The next item computes the value of `a bond
valence sum <extended/bvs.html>`__ using the set of marked paths. You
will be prompted for some information about the absorber and scatterer.

The next item causes all marked paths to be discarded from your fitting
project and removed from the path list.

The final two items are about controlling what gets transferred into the
plotting list after a fit. The next to last item causes all marked paths
to be transferred. The last item removes all paths from the list of
things transferred


The Debug menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _fig-datadebugmenu:
.. figure:: ../_images/data-debugmenu.png
   :target: _images/data-debugmenu.png
   :align: center

   The Debug menu.

This menu displays various dialog boxes showing aspects of the current
state of :demeter:`ifeffit` or :demeter:`artemis`. These are mostly
used for debugging purposes. This menu is only displayed if the
:configparam:`Artemis,debug_menus` configuration parameter is set to a
true value.


The Data help menu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _fig-datahelpmenu:
.. figure:: ../_images/data-helpmenu.png
   :target: _images/data-helpmenu.png
   :align: center

   The Help menu.


This menu is used to display the sections on the Data window or the
Path page from the document.
