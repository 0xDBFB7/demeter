Crystallography for EXAFS
=========================

This chapter provides an overview of crystallography tools as
implemented in :demeter:`artemis`. Crystallographic data is provided
either in the form of a CIF file or in a simpler format that has long
been the input format for my :demeter:`atoms` program.

Compared to other crystallography codes, the crystallography
capabilities in :demeter:`artemis` are, perhaps, a little crude and
incomplete. The goal is to provide enough functionality to support the
needs of the X-ray absorption spectroscopist.

This section discussed conventions for `denoting space
groups <space.html>`__, the details of calculations using `tables of
absorption coefficients <abs.html>`__, and provides a `worked
example <example.html>`__.
