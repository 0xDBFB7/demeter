Using path-like objects
=======================

The various kinds of path-like objects are used much like normal
paths.  In each case, the path-like object is associated with a data
set and appears in the data set's path list.  Path parameters are set
for the path-like object in exactly the same manner as for a normal
path.

**SSPaths**
  Single scattering paths (SSPaths) are explained `an earlier section
  of the document <../feff/pathlike.html#single-scattering-paths>`_
  and also in
