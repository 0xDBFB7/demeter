ATHENA: XAS Data Processing
===========================

::

   Just as Phaeacian men excel the world at sailing, driving
   their swift ships on the open seas, so the women excel at
   all the arts of weaving. That is Athena's gift to them
   beyond all others -- a genius for lovely work, and a fine
   mind too.
                                (Homer, The Odyssey, Book 7)

The Tholos sanctuary of Athena Pronoia, Athena of forethought.

Athena is the goddess of wisdom and craft, a fine patron for
