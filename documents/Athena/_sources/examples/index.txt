Worked examples
===============

This chapter presents two fleshed-out examples of performing specific
chores with :demeter:`athena`.  Here is a `zip file with all the
example data <https://s3.amazonaws.com/XAS-Education/Examples.zip>`_.

**Basic data processing**
    This example walks through the import and processing of several data
    files measured on an iron foil. Data calibration and alignment,
    parameter constraint, and merging are demonstrated in this example.
**Linear combination analysis**
    Using data measured on a variety of gold standards and a sequence of
    data measured on a system of cyanobacteria chemically reducing gold
    chloride to metallic gold.
