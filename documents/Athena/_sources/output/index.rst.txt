Data export
===========


Although :demeter:`athena` handles many of your XAS data processing
chores, there are many other things you may want to do with you data,
such as preparing beautiful plots for publication or importing data
into :demeter:`artemis`. This chapter explains the various kinds of
output files available in :demeter:`athena`.

There are three main types of export files, each of which is explained
on the following pages:

- Column data files useful for importing into other plotting programs

- Project files which capture the entire state of your current work in
  :demeter:`athena`. These can be re-imported into :demeter:`athena`,
  imported into :demeter:`artemis`, or emailed to your collaborator in
  another time zone.

- Report files summarizing parameter values for all the data groups in
  your project. These report files can be imported into spreadsheet
  or a database program.
