experiment to study the kinetics of the reduction of aqueous
Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride to metallic gold. The experiment is described and
these data are presented in</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>The experiment probed the mechanism of bioaccumulation of gold by the
interaction of a model cyanobacterium (Plectonema boryanum UTEX 485)
with aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride. This resembles a common
subsurface environment associated with gold deposits in various
locations around the world. In those environments, Au<sup>3+</sup>
chloride bearing fluids rise from the deep subsurface and wash over
bacterial mats. The bacteria die but their remains interact
chemically, reducing metallic gold from the fluid.</p>
<p>In our experiment, a culture of P. boryanum was sampled and placed in a
Teflon fluid cell appropriate for an XAS measurement. An aliquot of
Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride solution was titrated into the fluid cell and we
exited the hutch as quickly as possible. Overnight, we measured XAS
scans continuously. In the morning we set the sample aside, remeasuring
it every few hours until the end of the experiment. Finally we measured
a similar sample that had been prepared a week earlier. in this way, we
had a time sequence tracking the nearly complete reduction of
Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride to some form of colloidal gold. (The gold is
known to be colloidal from TEM measurements, we could not distinguish
colloidal and bulk gold in our XAS measurements.)</p>

<p>Import the <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> project file containing the gold standards and
gold/cyanobacteria data. You will see that it contains a subset of the
reduction sequence, including data data from 0.12 hours through 1 week.
Below the cyanobacteria data are several gold standards.</p>
<p>Note that these data have all been carefully calibrated, aligned, and
merged. Each measurement was made using a gold foil as an <a class="reference external" href="../import/ref.html">alignment
reference</a>.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the sequence of data measured on the
cyanobacteria on the left and a variety of gold standards on the right.
The plot on the left also shows the starting material, aqueous
Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride, and the end product, metallic gold. The data
clearly show the transformation over time between these two end members.
In particular, note the reduction of the white line intensity at about
11921.5 eV and the growth of the peak at about 11946.7 eV which is
characteristic of the metallic gold spectrum.</p>

</div><p id="_fig-aucllcf">The purpose of this experiment is two-fold. One goal is to determine the
reaction kinetics of the reduction. To that end, we will assume that the
data are a linear combination of aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride and
metallic gold and measure their relative fractions as a function of
time. The second goal is to determine whether the reduction involves an
intermediate state and, if so, to identify that species. Our strategy to
answer that question will involve adding other standard compound to our
mixture of aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride and metallic gold to see if
the data are better described by a ternary rather than binary mixture of
standard materials.</p>
<p>To begin, select one of the time points in the group list. Most
figures in this section show the data measured at 7.03 hours. Next,
select <span class="guilabel">Linear combination fit</span> from the main menu. This
replaces the main window with the linear combination fitting tool and
plots the data along with vertical lines indicating the extent of the
fitting range. From the first two drop-down menus, select
<span class="guilabel">Au foil</span> and <span class="guilabel">Au3 Cl aq</span>, as shown below.</p>

<p>In the operations list, click on <kbd class="light">Fit this group</kbd> to perform
the initial fit to these data. After the fit finishes, the result of
the fit, shown below is plotted. The tab labeled <span class="guilabel">Fit results</span>
becomes active. Clicking on it, we see that the fit tells us that the
data are 51±1 percent metallic gold. Given the quality of the fit, it
seems that we are well justified in our assumption that these data can
be modeled by a simple linear combination of the end members.</p>

<h2>12.2.3. Improving the fit<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-the-fit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As nice as this quick and easy result is, it's not perfect. A close
examination of the plot above shows quite a bit of misfit throughout
the entire fitting range. (Note that you can examine the misfit by
clicking the <kbd class="light">Plot difference</kbd> button and replotting the data
by clicking <kbd class="light">Plot data + sum</kbd> in the operations list.) This
misfit suggests that our hypothesis of an intermediate state between
Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride and metallic gold may be valid.</p>
<p>As a first guess for what that intermediate state might be, I think
should be something without a strong white line. The fit in the region
of the white line is pretty good. Looking at the various standards on
the right side of the first figure on this page I suspect that the
sulfur ligated species, Au sulfide, Au thiosulfate, or Au thiomalate,
are likely candidates. To test one, we need to add it to the list of
fitting standards on the <span class="guilabel">Standards spectra</span> tab and rerun the
fit. In the third row, select <span class="guilabel">Au sulfide</span> from the drop-down
menu, then click <kbd class="light">Fit this group</kbd> from the operations list.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id5">
<span id="fig-auclplussulfide"></span><a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/ex_aucl_plussulfide.png"><img alt="../_images/ex_aucl_plussulfide.png" src="../_images/ex_aucl_plussulfide.png" /></a>

</div>
<p>This is a noticeably better fit. The amount of misfit throughout the
fitting range and especially in the peak at about 11946.7 eV is smaller.
Examining the results tab, we see that the amount of Au<sup>3+</sup>
chloride is about the same as before but that the metallic gold content
is only 34±2 percent, with the sulfide taking up the remaining 18±2
percent.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="understanding-the-fit">
<h2>12.2.4. Understanding the fit<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-the-fit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The fit including the sulfide certainly looks better, but is it? The
results tab also reports some simple statistics from the fit. The
R-factor – a measure of mean square sum of the misfit at each data
point – was 0.000073 for the two-standard fit and shrank by a factor of
2 to 0.000035 for the three-standard fit. That confirms the observation
that the degree of misfit seems smaller in the plot of the
three-standard fit.</p>
<p>The reduced χ<sup>2</sup> of the fit also reduced by about a factor
of two, from 0.0000514 to 0.0000250, suggesting a substantive
improvement in the fit quality. Those are strange numbers, though. Any
textbook on scientific statistics will tell us that a good fit using a
non-linear, least-squares minimization (such as that used by
<font size=-1 color="#8C4112">IFEFFIT</font> and <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font>) should give 1 for a fit in
which the model is a good representation of the data. That is
certainly true, but supposes that you have a good determination of the
measurement uncertainty. We don't. In principle, the standard
deviation spectrum from the <a class="reference external" href="../process/merge.html">merge of measured data</a> could be used as an approximation of the
measurement uncertainty, but that is not possible in this case. The
data at 7.03 hours are a single measurement from a time
sequence. There is nothing to merge because each measurement is a
solitary measurement.  Consequently, <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> has to use 1 as
the value of the measurement uncertainty. That is grossly in excess of
the true measurement uncertainty, resulting in very small values for
χ<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>We cannot, therefore, assert that any particular fit is a good fit
simply by invoking what we know about Gaussian statistics. We can,
however, compare successive fits, such as the two we have made thus
far.  An improvement of a factor of 2 in the value of reduced χ<sup>2</sup> is certainly significant. We can, with confidence, state that
there is an intermediate component on the basis of the analysis
presented thus far.</p>
<p>But what is that intermediate. We have not yet proven its identity
(although gold sulfide is a strong contender!) because we have not yet
considered other options. There are two algorithmically distinct but
conceptually identical ways to attempt to solve this problem. One
involves the use of principle component analysis (a feature not yet
available in <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font>) of the data followed by target
transform analysis to attempt to identify the third species from among
the standards. The approach discussed here involves using
combinatorial techniques to directly test a library of standards
against our data.</p>
<p>The mathematics of these two approaches is quite different. Since they
share one major limitation, they are practically equivalent ways of
identifying the intermediate state. The limitation is that both
approaches require that the intermediate species be represented by the
library of standards. If that unknown species is absent from the
library, neither technique is able to identify it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="combinatorial-analysis">
<h2>12.2.5. Combinatorial analysis<a class="headerlink" href="#combinatorial-analysis" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Testing each standard against the data sounds like an unbearably
boring process – particularly since we may, in principle, want to
consider all possible binary, ternary, or higher combinations of
standards. The project file contains 9 standards. All possible
combinations of 2 or 3 standards from a pool of 9 results in 120
possibilities. Performing and recording the results from that many
fits sounds horrible. Fortunately, <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> knows how to
automate that chore.</p>
<p>First mark all of the standards and none of the cyanobacteria data. Then
click the <kbd class="light">Use marked groups</kbd> button. This will insert all of the
standards into the table.</p>
<p>By default, the table is only four rows long. You will need to exit
the linear combination fitting tool and open the <a class="reference external" href="../other/prefs.html">preference tool</a>. Set the
<font color="#636A24">♦Linearcombo→maxspectra</font> preference to at least 9. Return
to the linear combination tool and load the 9 standards into the
table.</p>
<p>Click the <span class="guilabel">Use at most</span> control down to three. At this point
you could click <kbd class="light">Fit all combinations</kbd> to begin fitting all
120 combinations of 2 and 3 standards. This is, however, a bit of a
waste of time. We <strong>know</strong> that there is metallic gold in these
data. The fifth column in the table of standards is labeled
<span class="guilabel">req.</span>, which is short for <em>required</em>. Click the radiobutton
in the <span class="guilabel">Au foil</span> row. This will cause the combinatorial
sequence to only consider combinations which include the metallic gold
standard. This reduces the number of binary and ternary combinations
to 36. Now click <kbd class="light">Fit all combinations</kbd> in the operations
list. This will take a while. It's a good time to get that cup of
coffee.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id6">
<span id="fig-lcfcombo2"></span><a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/lcf_combo.png"><img alt="../_images/lcf_combo1.png" src="../_images/lcf_combo1.png" /></a>

in the <span class="guilabel">combinatorics</span> tab.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once the sequence of fits finishes, <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> displays tables
containing the results of all of the fits in order of increasing
R-factor. The first column of the top table shows which standards were
included in the fits using the numbering scheme of the bottom
table. The other two columns show the R-factor and reduced χ<sup>2</sup> of each fit.</p>
<p>When you <img alt="leftclick" title="Left mouse button" src="../_static/leftclick.png" hspace="3"></a> click on a row in the top table, the
results of that fit are inserted into the bottom table and the fit is
plotted. When the combinatorial sequence finishes, the best fit of the
bunch is displayed.  It turns out the the combination of gold metal,
aqueous Au<sup>3+</sup> chloride, and gold sulfide that we examined
above is, in fact, the best fit. However, it is juts barely the best
fit. The fit with gold thiomalate in place of gold sulfide is just
barely worse. From a statistical perspective, the two fits are
equivalent and the amounts of metal and chloride in the fits are very
similar. The gold thiosulfate and gold thiocyanide fits are just a bit
worse yet. A couple of other fits show similar statistics but an
investigation shows that the peak around 11946.7 eV is not fit very
well. After that, the other fits in the table fall off quickly in
quality.</p>
<p>The conclusion that one can comfortably draw from this is that the
intermediate species is some sort of gold-sulfur complex. The aqueous
gold sulfide standard gave the best result by a hair, but the other
three species with a gold-sulfur ligand were statistically similar. To
model the kinetics in this system, I will use the sulfide species, but
it is probably not correct to say that the intermediate species is
aqueous gold sulfide. Rather it is some gold-sulfur complex formed when
the cyanobacteria bacteria cells lyse upon exposure to the Au<sup>3+</sup>
chloride solution.</p>

and unmark all of the standards in the group list. Now click on

step through the marked groups, applying the three-standard fitting
model to each one. Again, you may want to relax as you wait.</p>

cited at the beginning of the chapter. We have, as we set out to do,
examined the reaction kinetics and tentatively identified an
