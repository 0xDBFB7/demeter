<h2>10.1.1. Interpreting data as a mixture of standards<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-data-as-a-mixture-of-standards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> has a capability of fitting a linear combination of
standard spectra to an unknown spectra. These fits can be done using
normalized μ(E), derivative of μ(E), or χ(k) spectra. One
use of this sort of analysis might be to interpret the kinetics of
series of spectra measured during a reduction reaction. By fitting
each intermediate spectrum as a linear combination of the end members,
one can deduce the rate of the reaction. Another possible use would be
to determine the species and quantities of standards in a
heterogeneous sample.</p>
<p>A worked example of linear combination fitting is shown <a class="reference external" href="../examples/aucl.html">later in this
manual</a>.</p>
<p>To access this feature, choose <span class="guilabel">Linear combination fit</span> from

<h2>10.1.2. Fitting a single data group<a class="headerlink" href="#fitting-a-single-data-group" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The linear combination tool presents a table of menus. Each of these
menus can be used to select a spectrum from among the data groups
currently in the Data groups list. The basic idea of this tool is that
you will choose two or more standard spectra and fit a linear
combination of them to the current (i.e. the one highlighted in pale red
in the Data groups list) group. The fitting is done using the normalized
μ(E) spectra. If the standards or the unknown are to be flattened, then
the flattened spectrum will be used. (See <a class="reference external" href="../bkg/norm.html">the section on background
removal</a> for details about flattened spectra.)</p>
<p>You should have already done some data processing on the standards and
on the unknowns. Specifically, you should align your data and set
appropriate normalization parameters for each spectrum before starting
to use the linear combination fitting tool. Failing to adequately
prepare your data for these fits will certainly result in questionable
fits.</p>
<p>To do the fit, weighting parameters are defined for each standards
spectrum except for the last one in the list. The weight for the last
spectrum is one minus the sum of the other weights, thus constraining
the standards to be 100 percent of the unknown. Thus, if you used
three standards, the first two would have weights <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> and
the third would have weight <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1-x-y</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></code> would then be
varied to best fit the data. Each standard spectrum is interpolated
onto the energy grid of the unknown when the fit is performed as
normalized or derivative μ(E). The fit is performed over the data
range indicated by the text boxes near the top of the window. There
are pluck buttons which can be used to set the fitting range by
<img alt="leftclick" title="Left mouse button" src="../_static/leftclick.png" hspace="3"></a> double-clicking on a plot of the data.</p>
<p>Fitting normalized μ(E), derivative μ(E), or χ(k) is chosen using the
radio buttons just above the table of standards. When fitting χ(k)
spectra, you have the option of fitting a single spectrum to the data.</p>
<p>When fitting normalized or derivative μ(E) spectra, you have the
option of floating an E<sub>0</sub> for each standard
independently. This is intended to fix up any inconsistencies in the
energy alignment of the various spectra (although it is much better to
do a good job of aligning your data <em>before</em> doing your linear
combination fitting). These E<sub>0</sub> variables can be introduced by
clicking on the checkbuttons in the table of standard spectra.</p>
<p>You can introduce a linear offset to the fit to normalized μ(E)
spectra.  This is simple a line added to the sum of spectra in the
fit. It introduces two parameters to the fit, a slope and an
intercept. The line is multiplied by a step function centered at the
E<sub>0</sub> of the unknown. Thus the linear offset is introduced only after the
edge of the unknown. The purpose of this offset is to accommodate any
variations in how the normalization is performed on the various
spectra. To turn on the linear offset in the fit just click on the
button labeled <span class="guilabel">Add a linear term after e0?</span></p>
<div class="admonition caution">
<p class="first admonition-title">Caution</p>
<p class="last">For best results, you should do a good job of aligning and
normalizing your spectra <strong>before</strong> starting linear combination
analysis. When normalization and alignment are done correctly, you
can expect your fitted weights to sum to 1 and variation of
E<sub>0</sub> for the data or standards will be unnecessary.</p>

<div class="section" id="constraints-and-modifications-to-the-fit">
<h2>10.1.3. Constraints and modifications to the fit<a class="headerlink" href="#constraints-and-modifications-to-the-fit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font>'s linear combination tool offers several constraints to the
fitting parameters. The constraints are set and unset using the
checkbuttons near the bottom of the tool.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Weights between 0 and 1</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">You can constrain the variable weights to be between 0 and 1 by
clicking on the button labeled <span class="guilabel">Weights between 0 &amp; 1</span>.
In this case, each weight used is computed from the variable using
this formula:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">guess</span>  <span class="n">weight_varied</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">0.5</span>
<span class="k">def</span>    <span class="nf">weight</span>        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">min</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">weight_varied</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">The weight reported at the end of the fit, then, is the result of
that formula. Note that the use of the min/max idiom means that
uncertainties cannot be calculated for situations where the guess
variable gets pinned to 0 or 1. That can happen in situations where
one or more of the standards used in the fit is not appropriate to
the data and is an indication that you should rethink the set of
standards used in the fit. When this option is not selected, the
guessed variable itself is used as the weight in the fit and is not
prevented from being negative or larger than 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Force weights to sum to 1</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">You can loosen the constraint that the weights sum to 1 by
deselecting the final checkbutton. This allows the final weight to
float freely along with the rest rather than constrain it to equal 1
minus the sum of the rest, as described above. Loosening this
constraint might yield fit results that are hard to interpret. If
the constraint that weights must be between 0 and 1 is in place,
then the weight of the last standard in the fit is computed by this
formula:</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">def</span>  <span class="nf">weight_final</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">max</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w1</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">w2</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="o">...</span> <span class="n">wn</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p class="last">This forces the final weight to be positive, but may result in a
fit that does have weights that, in fact, do not sum to one. Should
that happen, it might be interpreted to mean that the normalization
of the data or standards was not correct or that the choice of
standards is not appropriate to the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><strong>Constrain all standards to use a single E0 shift</strong></dt>
<dd>You can force all standards to use a single E<sub>0</sub> shift parameter in
the fit. This is equivalent (albeit with a sign change) to fixing
all the standards and using an E<sub>0</sub> shift on the unknown data.</dd>
<dt><strong>Adding noise to the data</strong></dt>
<dd>It is sometimes useful to check the robustness of the fit against
noisy data. This is particularly true for a data set wherein some
data are much noisier than others. To this end, <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> allows you to
add pseudo-random noise to the data before performing the fit. This
is done by generating an array of psuedo-random numbers and adding
this array to the data. Given that normalized μ(E) is used in lCF
fits, σ(the scale of the noise) has a simple interpretation – it
is a fraction of the edge step. A bit of trial and error might be
necessary to find a suitable level of noise for your test. For fits
to χ(k), note that the noise is added to the data <strong>before</strong>
k-weighting. You can examine the level of noise relative to your
data before fitting by using the <kbd class="light">Plot data and sum</kbd> button from the
actions list.</dd>
<dt><strong>Adding a linear term to the fit</strong></dt>
<dd>A line with a variable slope and offset can be added to a fit. The
line is only evaluated after the E<sub>0</sub> value of data being fit.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fitting-statistics-reports">
<h2>10.1.4. Fitting, statistics, reports<a class="headerlink" href="#fitting-statistics-reports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To perform the fit, click <kbd class="light">Fit</kbd> from the actions
list. After the fit finishes, the data and the linear combination will
be plotted along with vertical bars indicating the range over which
the fit was evaluated. The values of all the fitting parameters are
written to the <span class="guilabel">Fit results</span> tab.</p>
<p>Interpretation of the statistical parameters in the linear combination
fit is somewhat challenging. There are two reasons for this, both of
which have to do with the fact that a non-linear, least-squares
minimization is used in the analysis.</p>
<p>First, it is difficult (perhaps impossible) to quantify the number of
independent measurements in the XANES spectrum. That number is certainly
less than the number of data points measured. Nonetheless, when the
chi-square is evaluated, the number of data points is used as the number
of measurements.</p>
<p>Second, <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> has no way of evaluating a measurement
uncertainty ε for the XANES measurement. A value of 1 is used for
ε in the equation for chi-square.</p>
<p>These two issues, taken together, mean that chi-square and reduced
chi-square tend to be very small numbers – much smaller than 1. As a
result, it is impossible to use reduced chi-square to evaluate the
quality of a single fit. Relative changes in chi-square between fits are
probably meaningful. However, given the two problems described above,
chi-square does not have a very different meaning from the R-factor.</p>
<p>The R-factor reported in the text box is</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> <span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">fit</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span> <span class="p">)</span>
<span class="o">------------------------</span>
 <span class="nb">sum</span> <span class="p">(</span>     <span class="n">data</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span>     <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where the sums are over the data points in the fitting region. The
chi-square and reduced chi-square are those reported by <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">IFEFFIT</font>.</p>
<p>Interpretation of the statistical parameters requires you to be mindful
of what you know about the system you are measuring. The statistical
parameters alone are not sufficient to evaluate the fit results. The
results of sample fractions must be meaningful in the context of any
external knowledge you have about the system.</p>
<p>You can replot the data and the fit using the most recent values for the
fitted parameters by clicking <kbd class="light">Plot</kbd> in the actions list.</p>
<p>You can save the text from the fit results box to a file by clicking
<kbd class="light">Write a report</kbd> in the actions list. This writes a column data file
with the fit results as the header information. The columns in the file
are x-axis (either energy or k), the data, the best fit, the residual,
and each of the weighted components.</p>
<p>You can make a data group out of the linear combination by clicking
<kbd class="light">Make fit group</kbd> in the actions list or out of the residual
by clicking <kbd class="light">Make difference group</kbd> in the actions
list. This will allow you to plot and manipulate the fit or difference
after leaving the linear combination tool. The data group containing
the fit result will be treated as normal data that can have a
background removed or be Fourier transformed. When you save a fit
using the derivative spectra, the fit group will be saved as a normal
μ(E) spectrum.</p>
<p><kbd class="light">Reset</kbd> in the actions list returns almost everything in
the tool back to its original state.</p>
<p>If you need more than four standards, the number of standards as well as
several other aspect of the linear combination fitting is configurable
using the <a class="reference external" href="../other/prefs.html">preferences tool</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="batch-processing">
<h2>10.1.5. Batch processing<a class="headerlink" href="#batch-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the choices in the actions list is to <kbd class="light">Fit marked
groups</kbd>. All groups marked by having their mark buttons checked
will be fit in the manner described above using the current selection
of fitting standards and other fitting options. When the sequence of
fits is finished, the <kbd class="light">Write marked report</kbd> option will
become enabled in the operation list.  This will allow you to write a
report in the form of a comma separated value file which summarizes
the results of the sequence of fits. This report file can be read into
any spreadsheet program.</p>
<p>Note that the report file will only reflect the fits done during the
batch job. Any changes made to the fitting model will not be included in
that report until a new batch job is performed.</p>
<p>Also note that the only way that the batch job is different from running
the same sequence of fits by hand is that the report file can be
generated. There is currently no way to generate a similar report from a
sequence of fits not run using the batch processing option. However, you
always have the option of saving individual fit reports as described
above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="combinatorial-fitting-using-many-standards">
<h2>10.1.6. Combinatorial fitting using many standards<a class="headerlink" href="#combinatorial-fitting-using-many-standards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the uses of this sort of XANES fitting is to try to figure out
what's actually in a sample. One approach to figuring this out is to
measure all plausible standard compounds and try fitting a large
number of different combinations of the standards to the
data. <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> provides a tool for automating this. Here is
how it works:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Load all of the standards that you want to consider into the table of
standards in the linear combination tool. You may need to increase
the maximum number of standards using the <a class="reference external" href="../other/prefs.html">preferences
tool</a> to provide enough space in the table
for all of the standards that you wish to consider.</li>
<li>You can limit the number of standards used in each fit with the
incrementer widget just below the button marked <kbd class="light">Use marked
groups</kbd>.  By default this number is 4, which says that the
fits will consider all possible binary, ternary, and quaternary
combinations of standards. Increase this number to consider higher
orders of combinations of standards. Decrease it to limit the
number of fits to perform. You can also indicate which standards
are “required” by clicking the check button in the
right-most column of the table of standards. This will limit the
combinations of standards tested against to data to those that
contain the required standards, thus greatly reducing the scope of
the combinatorial problem.</li>
<li>Click <kbd class="light">Fit all possible combinations</kbd> in the actions list and go get
a cup of coffee. If the number of possible standards is large, this
series of fits could take a while. For example, with 11 standards and
considering up to the quaternary combinations, <font size=-1 color="#8C4112">ATHENA</font> will perform
550 fits. (Really! C(11, 2) + C(11, 3) + C(11, 4) = 550!)</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this series of fits finishes, the tab labeled <span class="guilabel">Combinatorics</span> will
become active and raise to the top. In this tab, you will see two
tables. The top table concisely summarizes all the fits that were
performed, in order of increasing R-factor. Initially, the first item in
the list – which has the lowest R-factor – is selected (i.e.
highlighted in pale red).</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id2">
<span id="fig-lcfcombo"></span><a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/lcf_combo.png"><img alt="../_images/lcf_combo.png" src="../_images/lcf_combo.png" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 10.3 </span><span class="caption-text">The combinatorial fitting results tab.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The second table contains each of the standards and its weight and
E<sub>0</sub> from the fit selected in the upper table.</p>
<p>You can select a fit from the upper table by <img alt="leftclick" title="Left mouse button" src="../_static/leftclick.png" hspace="3"></a>
clicking on its line. When you do so, that fit becomes highlighted in
pale red, its fitting results are inserted in the bottom table, its
best fit function is plotted along with the data, and its results are
inserted into the other two tabs. In this way, you can examine any fit
from the series, as seen in the plot below.</p>
<div class="figure align-center" id="id3">
<span id="fig-lcfcombofit"></span><a class="reference external image-reference" href="../_images/lcf_combofit.png"><img alt="../_images/lcf_combofit.png" src="../_images/lcf_combofit.png" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-number">Fig. 10.4 </span><span class="caption-text">The best fit from a combinatorial sequence.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the selection of standards, it is reasonable that two or
more fits might have similar R-factors. You might interpret that to mean
that those fits are statistically indistinguishable or you might be able
to invoke some a priori knowledge to help choose between the similar
fits. Other fits farther down in the list will be obviously worse both
by statistical metric and by examination of their results.</p>
<p><img alt="rightclick" title="Right mouse button" src="../_static/rightclick.png" hspace="3"></a> Clicking the right mouse button on a fit in the
upper table will post a context menu with options relevant to the
selected fit. These options include saving the fit as a data group;
writing a data file with columns for the data, fit, residual, and each
weighted standard; saving the report from the <span class="guilabel">Fit results</span>
tab to a file; and writing a comma-separated-value report for the
entire combinatorial sequence which can be imported into a spreadsheet
program.</p>
<p>Beneath the tables is a button labeled <kbd class="light">Write CSV report for all
fits</kbd>.  Clicking this will prompt you for a file name and
location, then write a comma-separated-value report of all fits.</p>
<p>A worked example of linear combination fitting is shown <a class="reference external" href="../examples/aucl.html">later in this
manual</a>.</p>
