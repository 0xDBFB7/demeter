Full examples
=============

In this chapter, several full example fitting scripts are shown and
annotated. Hopefully, these examples will give you good ideas for your
own fits and demonstrate some :demeter:`demeter` idioms that you can
apply to your own scripts.

**Methyltin**
    Multiple data set fit with an demonstration of multiple k-weighting
    and cloning of :demeter:`demeter` objects.
**Silver/Gold alloy**
    Multiple data set fit to several silver/gold alloys of varying
    ratios making effective use of cloning and of the characteristic
    value.
**Uranyl ion**
    Uranyl ion in solution, demonstrating the use of the SSPath and
    VPath pathlike objects.
**Hg bound to synthetic DNA**
    Complex fit...
**Complex partial pair distributions as histograms**
    Modeling arbitrary pair distribution functions using
    `SSPath <../pathlike/sspath.html>`__ objects to represent bins in a
    histogram.
**Plot adornments**
    Adding eye candy to your plots. While :demeter:`demeter` is certainly not a
    full-featured plotting solution, it is capable of generating very
    complex plots with a relatively small amount of code.
**Using Demeter to write Ifeffit and Demeter scripts**
    To do...
