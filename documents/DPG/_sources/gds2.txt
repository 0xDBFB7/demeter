Parameter types
===============

There are 9 types of GDS parameetrs, that is, 9 possible values for the
``gds`` attribute. Several of these will be familiar to users of IFEFFIT
and ARTEMIS, a few are newly introduced by DEMETER.

 guess
    A parameter which is varied in a fit.
 def
    A parameter whose math expression is continuously updated throughout
    the fit.
 set
    A parameter which is evaluated at the beginning of the fit and
    remains unchanged after that.
 lguess
    A locally guessed parameter. In a multiple data set fit, this will
    be expanded to one guess parameter per data set. See `the section on
    local guess parameters <../lgcv.html>`__ for more details.
 restrain
    A restrain parameter is defined in an IFEFFIT script as a def
    parameter but is used as a restraint in the call to IFEFFIT's
    ``feffit`` command. In a multiple data set fit, all restraints are
    defined in the first call to the ``feffit`` command.
 skip
    A skip is a parameter that is defined but then ignored. Setting a
    variable to a skip is useful in a GUI as a way of “commenting out” a
    parameter without removing it from the fitting project.
 after
    This is like a def parameter, but is not used in the fitting model
    and only evaluated when the fit finishes. It is then reported in the
    log file.
 penalty
    This is like a def parameter, but is used as a user-defined penalty
    to the `happiness parameter <../fit/happiness.html>`__, which is
    evaluated at the end of the fit. This is not currently implemented.
 merge
    A merge is the type given to a parameter that cannot be
    unambiguously resolved when two Fit objects are merged into a single
    Fit object. A fit cannot proceed until all merge parameters are
    resolved. It is unlikely that a variable would ever be declared as a
    merge by a user, although if a user script makes use of any of
    DEMETER's (as yet unimplemented) project merging features, it will
    certainly be necessary to resolve a merge parameter by renaming it
    globally and resetting the ``gds`` attribute.

|To do!| Penalty and merge types are currently unimplemented.
