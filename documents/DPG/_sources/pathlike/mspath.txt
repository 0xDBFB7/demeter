MSPath object
=============

The MSPath, or :quoted:`multiple scattering path`, is the N-legged
extension of the SSPath.  It is not yet implemented. The syntax will,
however, be somewhat similar to the SSPath. Lists of ``ipot`` values,
leg lengths, and scattering angles will be input attributes.

.. todo:: Create MSPath class.
