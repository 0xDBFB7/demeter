=head2 Documentation contributions

=over 4

=item *

Write a web page explaining something about XAS.

=item *

Measure a library of reference materials for some element and share an
Athena project file containing the processed data.

=item *

Explain a data analysis problem in the form of a series of annotated
project files.

=item *

Make a video explaining how to do something with the software.

=item *

Give a lecture at an XAS training course.  Post your presentation and

=head2 Packaging contributions

=over 4

=item *

Make, support, and keep up-to-date installer packages for Debian based
systems, Red Hat based systems, other Linux distributions, or BSD.

=item *

Improve the Windows installer: add more XAS-related Start menu
options, add more perl-related Start menu options, write a better
README file for display upon installation, figure out how to dispense
with the useless dosbox, etc.

=item *

As a Windows updater, could something be done with git and automating
the build process?

=item *

Desktop functionality for Windows, Mac, KDE, GNOME/Unity, etc.  By
this I mean things like looking inside an Athena project file (a la
C<dlsprj>) and displaying that information in the file manager.  Or
showing an image of the most recent fit when an Artemis project file
is selected.

=head2 Programming contributions

=over 4

=item *

Identify and fix a bug in the codes.  Submit a patch to Bruce or issue
a pull request at L<https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter>.

=item *

Write a file type plugin for the weird data files from some weird
beamline.

=item *

Write an interesting and novel program using Demeter and share it with
the world.

=item *

I have long wanted to integrate
L<OpenBabel|http://openbabel.org/wiki/Main_Page> into Artemis.
OpenBabel is a framework for converting between molecule file formats.
The F<feff.inp> format could be integrated into OpenBabel by writing a
bit of C++.  With Feff integrated into OpenBabel, Demeter could use
OpenBabel's L<Perl interface|http://openbabel.org/wiki/Perl>.  This
means that any molecule format could be imported into Artemis and used
as the basis of a Feff calculation.  Writing the OpenBabel interface
and contributing it the OpenBabel project would be a most splendid
contribution to Demeter while at the same time opening up Feff support
to the many projects that use OpenBabel.
