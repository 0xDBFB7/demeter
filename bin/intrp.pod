=head1 NAME

intrp - Write a textual interpretation of a Feff calculation

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.2.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  intrp [option] myfeffcalc.yaml

If no yaml file is specified at the command line, F<feff.yaml>
in the current working directory will be used, if available.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This writes a concise summary of a Feff calculation to standard
output, providing useful information for interpreting the calculation
and begining to set up a fit.  The degeneracy and nominal path length
are reported as well as an summary of the scattering geometry of each
path.

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over 4

=item C<--color>

Write output using terminal ANSI colors.  This is the default
behavior.

=item C<--nocolor>

Suppress color output.  This is the default behavior if the terminal
colors are not available.

=item C<--latex>

Write output as a latex file ready to be compiled.  Note that the
output is written to the screen, so you may need to direct the output
to a file.

  intrp --latex myfeffcalc.yaml > myfeffcalc.tex

=item C<--html>

Write output in the form of an html page.  Note that the
output is written to the screen, so you may need to direct the output
to a file.

  intrp --html myfeffcalc.yaml > myfeffcalc.html

=item C<--noframe>

With this flag, the html or latex output will be written without the
header and footer.  That is, the output will be valid html or latex,
but will not contain the lines at the beginning and end of the file
necessary to make them free-standing html or compilable latex.

=item C<--rmax> or C<-r>

Restrict output to a given value of R.  If R is larger than the
longest path, all paths will be displayed.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

See L<Demeter::Config> for a description of Demeter's
configuration system.  The C<feff> configuration group controls many
aspects of the interpretation.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses L<Term::ANSIColor> to color the terminal output, but
it defaults gracefully to colorless output if this module is not
available.

This reads the L<YAML|http://www.yaml.org> output from Demeter's
reimplementation of Feff's pathfinder.  This version of C<intrp> does
B<not> do its interpretation using F<feff.inp>, F<files.dat>, and
F<paths.dat>, like earlier incarnations and will B<not> do an
interpretation of your non-Demeter Feff calculations.

The dependencies of the Demeter system are in the
F<Bundle/DemeterBundle.pm> file.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

See L<Demeter::Feff> and L<Demeter::ScatteringPath>
for bugs and limitations of the underlying libraries.
