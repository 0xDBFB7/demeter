=head1 NAME

atoms - Convert crystallography data to a feff.inp file

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.2.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  atoms [flag] [-r #] mydata.inp

If no input or CIF file is specified at the command line, F<atoms.inp>
in the current working directory will be used, if available.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This reads an atoms input file or a CIF file (CIF is not working at
this time) and writes out the results of a calculation using that
crystallography data.  Typically the output is a F<feff.inp> file, but
it may also be a summary of the space group, calculation using tables
of X-ray absorption coefficients, etc.

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

By default, an input file for Feff6 is written.  This and aspects of
the F<feff.inp> file can be overridden from the command line.
