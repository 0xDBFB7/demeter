dfeff - Run Demeter's implementation of Feff6

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.2.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  dfeff <--workspace=/path/to/folder/> [options] <myfeff.inp>

If no input file is specified, F<feff.inp> is used.  If no workspace
is specified on the command line, the current directory is used.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This runs Demeter's implementation of Feff6 somewhat similarly to how
the normal Feff behaves.  The default behavior of this program is to
run through all parts of the Feff calculation, starting with reading
the input file and ending with writing the F<feffNNNN.dat> files.
However, this program allows considerably more control over the Feff
run than you get from the normal Feff.

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

You can specify a Feff input file at the command line.  This input
file can have any name (it is not restricted to F<feff.inp> as in
Feff6) and need not be in the current working directory nor in the
workspace where the Feff calculation will be made.  A copy of the
input file will be placed in the workspace.

You can specify the folder in which the Feff calculation will be made
using the C<--workspace> command line switch.

=over 4

=item C<-w> or C<--workspace>

Specify a folder in which to run this feff calculation.  If
unspecified, the current work directory will be used.

=item C<--rmax>

Specify a maximum path length, in Angstroms.

=item C<--all>

Run all parts of Feff.  This is the default behavior if none of the
following three flags are set.

=item C<--potentials>

Run the potentials portion of the Feff calculation.

=item C<--pathfinder>

Run the pathfinder portion of the Feff calculation.

=item C<--ff2chi>

Write out all F<feffNNNN.dat> files found by the pathfinder.

=item C<--save>

Save the temporary files written out during the feff calculation.

=item C<--keep>

Use Feff's curved wave keep criterion when generating F<feffNNNN.dat>
files.

=item C<-q> or C<--quiet>

Suppress screen messages during the Feff run.

=item C<-v> or C<--version>

Display version information and quit.

=item C<-h> or C<--help>

Display help information and quit.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

See L<Demeter::Config> for a description of Demeter's
configuration system.  See the C<feff> configuration group.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This script uses L<Term::ANSIColor> to color the terminal output, but
it defaults gracefully to colorless output if this module is not
available.

The dependencies of the Demeter system are in the
F<Bundle/DemeterBundle.pm> file.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

See L<Demeter::Feff> and L<Demeter::ScatteringPath>
for bugs and limitations of the underlying libraries.

There should be an option for running Feff's pathfinder for the sake
of bug testing Demeter's pathfinder or for using paths with more than
4 legs.
