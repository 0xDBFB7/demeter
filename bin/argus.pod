=head1 NAME

argus - Demeter's data watcher

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Ifeffit::Demeter version 0.2.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Monitor the progress of a sequence of XAS scans and generate an Athena
project file at the end.

Specify parameters from the command line:

  argus [options] data_file

or enter processing parameters interactively at the command line:

  argus -i

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Argus monitors the progress of a sequence of XAS measurements.  You
point it at the directory where you data are saved and give it the
basename of sequence of data files.  As new scans arrive on disk,
Argus will see them, align them, and plot them.  When you hit
Control-C to quit the program, Argus will compute the merge of the
data and write everything to an Athena project file.

Argus only plots un-normalized mu(E).  The only data processing
performed is alignment of subsequent data files to the first data one.
There are no options for plotting other views of the data nor for
performing more elaborate data processing (such as calibration).
Argus is intended to serve the rather narrow purpose of keeping tabs
on an ongoing experiment and expediting the creation of an Athena data
file for further data processing.

Before begining to monitor the disk, Argus will display a summary
of the parameters:

        Monitoring     :  ../examples/foo/fe.*
        Starting with  :  000
        Energy column  :  $1
        mu(E)          :  ln( $2 / $3 )
        Rebinning      :  no
        Pause          :  5 seconds
        Header size    :  2000 bytes

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=head2 Setting parameters from the command line

Here is an example of pointing Argus' attention at a sequence of files
called F<data/fe.*>.  In this example, the data are in transmission
with the I0 channel in column 5 and the It channel in column 7.

  argus --folder=data --numerator='$5' --denominator='$7' --ln fe

Note that the columns are specified in a manner similar to the gnuplot
plotting program.  That is, a column is specified using a dollar
sign. In most shells, you will have to escape the dollar sign using
single quotes.

Default values for the command line switches are given in square
brackets.

=over 4

=item C<--folder> or C<-f>

Specify the directory where the data is saved.

=item C<--energy> or C<-e> I<[ $1 ]>

Specify the column containing the energy array.

=item C<--numerator> or C<-n> I<[ $2 ]>

Specify the column containing the data to go in the numerator when
constructing mu(E).  For transmission data, this should be the I0
column.  With a Lytle or electron yield detector, this would be column
containing that channel.

For multielement detector data, this can be a sum of columns.  For
example, a four element detector might be imported and summed as

   $4+$5+$6+$7

=item C<--denominator> or C<-d> I<[ $3 ]>

Specify the column containing the data to go in the denominator when
construcing mu(E).  For transmission data, this would be the It
column.  For transmission or electron yield data, this would be the I0
column.

=item C<--ln> or C<-l> I<[ false (fluorescence) ]>

This is a boolean flag which should be true for transmission data.
When true, the natural log will be used to compute mu(E).

=item C<--rebin> or C<-r> I<[ false (don't rebin) ]>

This is a boolean flag indicating whether to rebin the data as it is
imported.

=item C<--start> or C<-s> I<[ 000 ]>

This is the starting file extension.  Files with extensions which are
B<stringwise less than> this value will be ignored by argus.  As an
example, consider a series of XANES scans called F<mydata.000> through
F<mydata.010> and the full EXAFS scans start with F<mydata.100>.
Argus might then be called with C<--start=100> to exclude the XANES
scans from monitoring.

=head2 Operational parameters

=over 4

=item C<--pause> I<[5 seconds]>

This is the amount of time Argus sleeps between checking to see if a
new file has appeared.  It is very important that the pause not be of
similar size to or smaller than the dwell time at each point in a step
scan.  Argus uses a simple check of file size to determine if a scan
has finished and is ready to be imported.  If the dwell time is longer
than the pause, then Argus will mistakenly assume that a scan has
finished.  On a beamline that offers k-weighted dwell times, be sure
to choose a pause time that is suitable even at the end of the scan.

=item C<--headersize> I<[2000 bytes]>

To avoid importing an aborted scan and to deal with quick-scanning
beamlines, this parameter sets the minimum size in bytes of a data
file that will be considered for import by Argus.  You want to be sure
that this is larger than the header portion of the data file.

On a quick-scanning beamline, one solution (this is the solution used
at APS Sector 10) to disk IO is to write the header of the file at the
beginning of the scan and the data at the end of the scan.  This runs
the risk of early triggering Argus' mechanism for determining when a
scan has finished.  As long as this parameter is larger than the size
of the header written at the beginning of the scan, the file will be
ignored until the data is written to disk.

=item C<--flush> I<[30]>

This sets the maximum number of data files that are written to a
single Athena project file.  When the count of data files hits this
number, a project file is written, memory is flushed, and a new
project file is started.  The first data file is re-imported and used
as the alignment standard for the subsequent data files.  Thus all
data in all project files are aligned to the same alignment standard.

=item C<-g>

Use the gnuplot plotting backend rather than pgplot.  The default is
to use pgplot.

=head2 Setting parameters interactively

You can also identify the data sequence and set the processing
parameters interactively.  This is triggered using the C<-i> or
C<--interactive> switch.

When interactive mode is used, the program begins with a series of
questions.  It looks like this:

   Which directory should we monitor? [default is ./] > ../examples/foo
   What file basename shall we monitor? > fe
   What is the energy column? [default is $1] >
   Which columns make up the numerator? [default is $2] >
   Which column is the denominator? [default is $3] >
   Is this transmission or fluorescence data? [t or f]> t

Other command line switches are recognized in interactive mode, with
their values becoming the defaults.  Note that the C<pause>,
C<headersize>, and C<flush> parameters are not set interactively and
B<must> be set from the command line.
