=head1 NAME

lsprj - List contents of an Athena project file

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Ifeffit::Demeter version 0.1.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  lsprj my.prj

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program writes out a list of the labels for each group in an
Athena project file.  This, then, is a quick way of peering inside a
project file without actually opening it.

The data from the project file can also be plotted by supplying the
optinal C<--plot> command line switch.

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over 4

=item C<--plot> or C<-p>

Optionally plot the data from the project file in the specified
plotting space.  The plotting options are

=over 4

=item e

plot mu(E)

=item n

plot normalized mu(E)

=item d

plot derivative mu(E)

=item k

plot k^2-weighted chi(k)

=item r

plot the magnitude of chi(R) Fourier tranformed with k^2 weighting

=item q

plot the real part of chi(q)

=back

Values for data processing parameters are taken from the Athena
project file.  This is intended for quick-n-dirty display, so very few
plotting options are available.

Note that for large project files, the plot will be time consuming and
cluttered.  This option is most useful for smaller project files.

=item C<--stack>

Data plotted as normalized mu(E), chi(k), chi(R), or chi(q) are
stacked, with each subsequent trace being shifted downward by
0.2.  The amount of the shift can be specified with this switch.

=item C<--params>

A comma separated list of data processing parameters to include in the
list of groups.  This is a bit awkward to use in that you must specify
the parameters using their internal representations as given explained
in the documentation for L<Ifeffit::Demeter::Data>.  For instance,
this will show the values for the background removal R_bkg and the
forward Fourier transform kmin value:

  lsprj my.prj --params=bkg_rbkg,fft_kmin,
   ==prints==>
        1 : HgO        bkg_rbkg=1.0    fft_kmin=2
        2 : HgS black  bkg_rbkg=1.0    fft_kmin=2
        3 : HgS red    bkg_rbkg=1.0    fft_kmin=2
