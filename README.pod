=item C<Programming documentation>

The POD documentation is the documentation embedded into each module
contained in a Demeter distribution.  The PODs have been nicely
formatted for html and organized into a hierarchical structure that
looks like a CPAN project page.

=item C<Demeter Programming Guide>

The DPG is a how-to guide written at a higher level than the
proramming documentation.  It includes descriptions of how to use the
main components of Demeter as well as several complete examples.
