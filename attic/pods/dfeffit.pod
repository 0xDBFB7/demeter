dfeffit - Read and use a feffit.inp file

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.3.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Process a F<feffit.inp> file with Demeter.

  dfeffit [-r -i -p -q] inputfile savefile

If no save file is given on the command line, the script will be
echoed to the screen.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script is a wrapper around L<Demeter::Fit::Feffit> and can be
used to run the fit encoded in a feffit input file or to convert the
input file either to an Ifeffit script or to a perl script using
Demeter.

=head1 COMMAND LINE SWITCHES

=over 4

=item C<-r>

Run a fit using the information in the C<feffit.inp> file.  Specifying
this flag will override either of the C<-i> or C<-p> flags when (for
some reason) more than one is specified on the command line.

If the fit is run, a log file and a project file will be written and
the interview method will be called.  See L<Demeter::UI::Screen::Interview>.

=item C<-i>

Generate an ifeffit script which is equvalent to the C<feffit.inp>
file.

=item C<-p>

Generate a perl script which uses Demeter and is equvalent to the
C<feffit.inp> file.  This is the default behavior.

=item C<-q>

Suppress the echoing of the script to the screen.  This is useful with
the -r flag.
