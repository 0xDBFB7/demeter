* Introduction
** Explain that concepts are largely the same but with imporvements
** Explain main window and plot window
** Demonstrate importing data from an Athena project file
** Demonstrate importing crystal data

* Running Atoms and Feff
** Import gold crystal data again
** Cluster size and longest path
** Style
** Run atoms
** Run Feff
** Plot paths

* Assign a path to a data set and run a simple fit
** Drag n drop
** Open GDS window
** Make some fitting and path parameters
** Check data/fit parameters
** Run a one-shell fit
** plot
** log file

* Assign many paths to a data set and run a multi-shell fit
** Drag n drop
** Open GDS window
** Make some fitting and path parameters
** Check data/fit parameters
** Run a multi-shell fit
** plot
** log file

* Plot window
** Transfer data and paths
** Tour through limits tab
** stack tab
** indic tab

* Virtual paths
** Transfer all paths from the 4th shell distance and plot them with the data
** Set up a virtual path of all paths at the fourth shell distance
** Plot

* Features of the GDS page

* Importing other things

* SSPaths

* Quick first shell

* Histograms

* Exporting iff or pl

* Complex examples
** More than one feff calculation
** MDS fit
