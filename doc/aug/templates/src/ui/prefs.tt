[% athena %] allows you to set an enormous number of preferences.
Many dozens of things that could conceivably be configured can, in
fact, be configured using this dialog.  In any situation where is was
not obvious to me that there was a best, most proper value for a
parameter, I chose a default and made an entry for it in the
preference dialog.  The preference dialog is shown
[% INCLUDE imageref text="here" label="prefs" in=1 %].
[% END %]

[% athena %]'s preferences dialog.

I am not going to explain this dialog in great detail.  I am trusting
that if you are sufficiently motivated to configure the behavior of
[% athena %] to be something other than what comes out of the box, you will
also be sufficiently motivated to follow your nose through the use of
this dialog.

The preference parameters are divided into related groups.  For
example, there are groups for background removal parameters, alignment
parameters, colors, and so on.

To view a group of preferences, click on the little cross sign next to
the group's name in the list on the left side of the dialog.  This
will open a branch containing all the parameters in tat group.  Click
on one of them and it will be displayed in the controls on the left.

Click on the default button to restore [% athena %]'s default value
or use the control below the default button to set a new value.  That
control will vary depending on the type of parameter.  A text or
numeric parameter will offer an entry box.  A color parameter will
offer a button which pops up a color selection dialog.  A list
parameter will offer a menu with the choices.  And so on.

The text area below these controls displays an explanation of the
function served by that preference.  Underneath that are buttons for
setting or saving the parameters.

The data about the preferences is contained in the
[% INCLUDE font/file a="athena.config" %] which can be found in the
disk space where [% athena %] is installed on your computer.  This
files is used to construct the preferences dialog.  It is also the
master file used when building [% athena %] from source to create the
system-wide initialization file as well as a the part of
[% athena%]'s source code which sets the internal defaults for the
parameters.  It should never be necessary to work with the
[% INCLUDE font/file a="athena.config" %] file.  I just mention this
for the benefit of the interested reader.
