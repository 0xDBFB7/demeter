[% athena %] can be used successfully by using relatively few of its
capabilities.  For instance, it's fairly obvious that you can import
data by opening a file using the File menu, change a parameter value
by editing the number in one of the little boxes in the main window,
or plot data by clicking one of the buttons labeled with the letters
E, k, R, or q.  There is, however, a lot more to [% athena %] at the
level of its user interface.  Part of making the leap from beginner to
expert is learning about the various user interface features.

One aspect of [% athena %]'s user interface that requires special
explanation is the [% INCLUDE font/quote a="Show additional parameters" %]
button at the top of the background removal parameters section of the
main window.  Clicking it, changes the display of the background
removal parameters, replacing the main parameters with a set of
additional parameters which can be used to fine tune normalization and
background removal.

The main parameters can be restored by clicking the
[% INCLUDE font/quote a="Show main parameters" %]
button.  The additional parameters are all described elsewhere in this
document.
