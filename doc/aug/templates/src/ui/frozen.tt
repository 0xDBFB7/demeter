There is a feature that [% athena %] shares with almost any other
computer program -- not just analysis programs, but any program.  Soon
after starting to use [% athena %], you will do something silly and
regrettable.  Often this is as simple as changing a parameter to some
bad value and forgetting what the good value was.  To help mitigate
this sort of problem, [% athena %] allows you to
[% INCLUDE font/em a="freeze" %] data groups.

A frozen group is one for which you cannot change its parameter
values.  When a group is frozen, the entry boxes associated with
parameters become deactivated, which means that it is impossible to
type in them.  Furthermore, any global action such as constraining
parameters or using the alignment dialog, will have no effect on the
frozen group.

The idea behind frozen groups is that, after working for a while to
find parameter values that you like, you can freeze the group to avoid
inadvertently altering its parameters.  The various group freezing
functions can be found in the Values menu, as shown in
[% INCLUDE imageref text="the screenshot below" label="ui_freeze" %].
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER figure file="ui_freeze.png" %]
The frozen groups submenu is found under the Values menu.  Several
visual cues indicate that a group is frozen, including the green
highlighting the group list and the use of italic text in the main menu.

The [% INCLUDE font/quote a="Freeze groups" %] submenu offers a
number of ways of selecting which
groups to freeze.  The frozen state of the current group can be
toggled by typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='f' %] and
all groups can be frozen or unfrozen by typing
[% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='F' %] or
[% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='U' %].  You can also freeze or
unfreeze all marked groups.  Finally, you can mark or unmark all
groups using regular expressions.  This works in the same manner
[% INCLUDE html/link link="mark.html#usingregularexpressionstomarkgroups"
text="using regular expressions to mark groups" %].

There are various visual changes when a group is frozen.  The
highlight color in the group list changes from light red to light
green.  The text in the group list becomes italic.  The labels for
each section of parameters in the main window becomes italic.
Finally, the label in the main window that normally says
[% INCLUDE font/quote a="Current group" %] is changed to
[% INCLUDE font/quote a="Frozen group" %].


When a group is frozen, direct edits of parameter values are
disallowed.  Frozen groups are skipped for algorithmic edits, such as
parameter constraints or alignment.  You can, however, still remove a
frozen group from the project.  Unfreezing a group is a simple as
hitting [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='f' %] again.
