[% FILTER html_para %]
[% athena %]'s palettes are a space where a variety of kinds of
textual information are stored or displayed.  They are mostly things
that do not need to be displayed front and center, they are displayed
when summoned from the Edit menu or by a keyboard shortcut.
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER figure file="palettes.png" %]
The palettes window with the journal palette showing.  This particular
journal entry is taken from the alignment and merging demo file.
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER html/list type="dl" %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Ifeffit" %]
This is the space where you can interact directly with [% ifeffit%].
This palette contains a buffer which displays every  command sent
to [% ifeffit%] as well as its response.  At the bottom of the
palette is a command line where any [% ifeffit%] command can be typed
and entered.  When focus is on the command line, the up and down
arrow keys scroll through the history of commands typed at this
command line.  The [% ifeffit %] buffer is very helpful for those
wanting to learn how to use [% ifeffit %] directly.
Typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='1' %] displays this palette.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Titles" %]
This palette is used to display the title lines associated with the
current data group.  Any title lines interpreted as such in the
original data file will be displayed here.  You can also add your
own comments.  The contents of this palette will be written to the
header of any output column data file.  The titles are also stored
with the data group in a project file.
Typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='2' %] displays this palette.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Data" %]
This palette is used to display the actual data file from which a
data group was read.  This can only be done during the session in
which the data was initially imported into [% athena %].  A project
file does not retain enough information to make use of this
palette.  This palette is the one and only way that [% athena %] can
be used to modify a data file.  You can edit your data file in this
palette and save it back to disk.  Use this capability with caution
or, preferably, not at all.
Typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='3' %] displays this palette.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Echo" %]
This palette contains a buffer which displays a history of messages
displayed in the echo area.
Typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='4' %] displays this palette.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Macro" %]
This palette contains a tool for capturing [% ifeffit %] command and
writing them to an output file.  The concept is that you can capture
commands for a particular operation and use the output file to
create an [% ifeffit %] macro for use outside of [% athena %].
Typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='5' %] displays this palette.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Journal" %]
[% UNLESS document_style == 'pod' %][% INCLUDE image file="LightningBolt.png" %][% END %]
This palette is one of [% athena %]'s most important tools.  It is
a blank space in which you can write anything you want.  The
contents of this space are included when a project file is saved and imported
into this space when a project file is imported.  Thus, this serves
as a journal for your data analysis.  You can use this space to
comment on your data and on the choices you make while working with
your data.  This enhances the value of the project file as a
collaborative tool.  Just as the project file is an excellent way to
share data with a colleague, you can use the journal to exchange
information or have a conversation with your colleague.
Typing [% INCLUDE modkey key="control" letter='6' %] displays this palette.
