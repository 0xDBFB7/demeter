Peak fitting involves fitting a number of analytical line shapes to
XANES data.  The typical approach is to simulate the XANES data using
one or two step-like function and several Gaussians or Lorentzians for
the peaks in the data.  The centroids, amplitudes, and widths of the
various line shapes are either fixed or varied to best fit the data.
In [% athena %]'s implementation of peak fitting, a
Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least-squares minimization is used.
(To be specific, [% ifeffit %]'s [% INCLUDE font/mono a="minimize" %]
command is used after constructing an array with a sum of line shapes.)

Peak fitting is an inherently empirical analysis technique.  By
themselves, the line shapes used have little physical meaning.  The
utility of peak fitting is in quantifying the variation of certain
spectral features in a sequence of data.  As an example, consider the
small peak that appears just before the main rising part of the edge
in a titanate perovskite.  In
[% INCLUDE imageref text="the plot below" label="peak_fit" %], this is
the peak around 4968 eV.  This peak varies as a function of
temperature as you approach then exceed the crystallographic phase
transition.  The size of the peak can be related to the amount of
distortion in this tetragonal structure.  Peak fitting is a useful
tool in this temperature-dependent study as it can quantify the
relationship between a spectral feature and an extrinsic parameter.

Two other obviously useful functions are not available in the current
version of [% athena %], the pseudo-Voight (typically implemented as a
weighted sum of a Gaussian and a Lorentzian) and the Cromer-Lieberman
calculation of the bare atomic edge step (which might better
approximate the shape of the XANES data).

Each line shape has an independent centroid, amplitude, and width.  By
default, the centroids are fixed and the amplitude and width are
varied in the fit.  Which parameters are fixed and which are varied
are controlled by the check buttons in the columns labeled
[% INCLUDE font/quote a="Fit" %].  The
[% INCLUDE html/link text="pluck button" link="../ui/pluck.html" %]
next to the centroid can be used to grab a value from the plot.

In my experience, the fits are fairly unstable when the centroids are
varied, particularly with peak functions placed close together.  I
typically leave the centroid values fixed, adjusting them by hand and
rerunning the fits if necessary.

The peak shapes are unit normalized.  This means that the amplitude
[% INCLUDE font/b a="is" %] the area under the peak.

The result of a fit can be saved as a group in the group list for
later comparison to your data.  The log file is a column data file
containing the fit results in the header and columns of

Humble confession: the peak fitting dialog is one of the weaker parts
of [% athena %].  It is serviceable, but somewhat buggy and missing
some important features.  One of these days it will get some more of
my attention.
