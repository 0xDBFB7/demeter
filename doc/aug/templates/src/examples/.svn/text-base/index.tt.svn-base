[% FILTER html_para -%]
This chapter presents several fleshed-out examples of performing
specific chores with [% athena %].  At this time there are three
examples.  More may be added in future versions of this document.

[% WRAPPER html/list type="dl" %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Basic data processing" %]
This example walks through the import and processing of several data
files measured on an iron foil.  Data calibration and alignment,
parameter constraint, and merging are demonstrated in this example.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="A difficult background removal problem" %]
[% moo3 | trim %] presents a particularly challenging background removal
problem.  This example demonstrates an iterative approach to
background removal.  After an initial removal, the [% moo3 %] are
analyzed in [% artemis %] using a simple model and that information is
used to improve upon the background removal in [% athena %].
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/dt dt="Linear combination analysis" %]
Using data measured on a variety of gold standards and a sequence of
data measured on a system of cyanobacteria chemically reducing gold
chloride to metallic gold.
