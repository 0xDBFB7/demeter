[% FILTER html_para %]
When data is imported in [% athena %], all parameters are set to their
default values.  For most data, these defaults are reasonable in the
sense that using them will result in a decent first stab at background
removal and Fourier transform.  The sequence of choices [% athena %]
makes in setting those defaults is somewhat complicated and highly
configurable.  By understanding how the defaults are chosen, you can
tune [% athena %] to do a good job processing your more of your data
without your intervention.

The choices of default values for each parameter is made by walking
through a hierarchy of decisions, each subsequent level overriding the
previous level.  The first decision is made by consulting
[% INCLUDE html/link text="the program preferences" link="../ui/prefs.html" %].
The program preferences are read from two initialization files when
[% athena %] starts.  The first initialization file is a system-wide
file that always contains [% athena %]'s fresh-out-of-the-box
parameter defaults.  The second initialization file is your own
personal collection of preferences.  These personal preferences are
typically set using the preferences dialog, which is found in Settings
menu.  The values found among the personal preferences will always
override the system-wide set.

Many of the parameter defaults which can be set in the preferences
dialog have the option of being set to relative values rather than
absolute values.  For example, the
[% INCLUDE preference group="Fft" option="kmax" %] parameter can be
set to a value such as [% INCLUDE font/quote a="12" %].  It can also
be set to a value like [% INCLUDE font/quote a="-1" %], which tells
[% athena %] to select the value 1 wavenumber from the end of the data
as the value for [%- PROCESS preference group="Fft" option="kmax" %].
All of the range parameters can be set to values which are relative to
the extent of the actual measured data.  These options are explained
in the parameter description on the preferences dialog.

The preferences can be overridden by setting [% INCLUDE font/em
a="session defaults" %].  The session defaults can be set for
individual parameters in the right-click context menu for each
parameter
[% INCLUDE html/link link="constrain.html#constrainingindividualparameters" text="" %],
for each group of parameters
[% INCLUDE html/link link="constrain.html#constraininggroupsofparameters" text="" %],
or for all parameters in the Values menu.  The
session default is taken from the value for the current group and is
then used as the default parameter value for each subsequent data
group as it is imported.  These values do not persist between
[% athena %] session.  Once you close [% athena %], the set of session
defaults is lost.

The concept behind session defaults is to provide a mechanism for
handling data that is not well handled by the preferences.  For
example, on the beamline computer I typically have [% athena %]'s
preferences tuned to work well for the uranium [% l3 %] data my group
usually collects.  When working on other edges, I will often set
session defaults once I get a feeling for what parameter values work
well for those data.

Overriding the session defaults is the
[% INCLUDE html/link text="data preprocessing mechanism" link="../import/preproc.html" %].
When data preprocessing is performed and the option to set parameter
values to the preprocessing standard is selected, those values will
override all session defaults and preferences.
