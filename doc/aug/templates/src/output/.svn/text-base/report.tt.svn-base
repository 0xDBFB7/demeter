[% FILTER html_para %]
The final kind of output file is a parameter report.  In the Edit
menu, you will find a submenu labeled
[% INCLUDE font/quote a="Write a report" %], shown
[% INCLUDE imageref text="below" label="export_report" in=1 %].  The various
options in that submenu write out files containing the parameters from
the main window.
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER figure file="export_report.png" %]
Writing a report on data groups in [% athena %].
[% END %]

[% FILTER html_para %]
The first two options write all the parameters to an Excel file, the
second two options write the same information to a simple comma
separated value file, the next two options write the information to a
plain text file.  In each case, you have a choice of saving parameters
from all groups or only the marked groups.
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER figure file="export_excelreport.png" %]
An example of the Excel spreadsheet output displayed in OpenOffice.
[% END %]

[% FILTER html_para %]
The last option in the list is a way of moving data from
[% athena %] to the Xfit analysis program.  If you know what that
is, you probably already know how to use this output file.  If you
have no idea what I am talking about, it is unlikely to matter to
you.  Really.
