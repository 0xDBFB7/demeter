[% FILTER html_para %]
[% athena %] offers a variety of data processing chores -- chores
which modify the data in some way to prepare it for more extensive
analysis.  With the exception of merging data groups, all data
processing features are accesses through the Data menu, shown
[% INCLUDE imageref text="below" label="process" in=1 %].  All the
entries in the Data menu, replace the main window with a dialog
specially designed for the data processing chore.

You can work on more than one data group in any dialog without having
to return to the main menu.  Clicking on a group label in the group
list will make that group current, display parameters appropriate to
the data processing dialog, and plot the data in some appropriate
manner.

When you are finished using the data processing dialog, you can press
the button labeled [% INCLUDE font/quote a="Return to the main window" %].
Doing so will close the special dialog and redisplay the main
window.
