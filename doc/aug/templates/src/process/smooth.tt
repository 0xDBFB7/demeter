[% META title = 'Smoothing data' %]

[% FILTER html_para %]
Smoothing data is usually a bad idea.  The way to improve noisy data
is to measure more of it and rely upon the
[% INCLUDE html/link text="central limit theorem"
link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem" %] to work
its magic.  Smoothing is usually little more than an aesthetic fix and
it introduces distortions to your data that become serious sources of
systematic uncertainty in any later attempts to analyze the smoothed
data.

Be that as it may, [% athena %] gives you a few smoothing options. One
applies [% ifeffit %]'s three-point smoothing algorithm repeatedly to
your data.  The number of iterations can be set using the number
selection control.  The other is a wacky sort of Fourier thing that I
once wrote.  On occasion it works fine, usually it sucks.

Eventually I plan to
implement a [% INCLUDE html/link text="Savitsky-Golay filter"
link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savitzky%E2%80%93Golay_smoothing_filter" %].

You can overplot the data and the smoothed data using the button on the
left, as shown
[% INCLUDE imageref text="below" label="smooth" in=1 %].
The button on the right makes a group out of the smoothed data
and places it in the group list.
