The statement that [% mu %] measured in fluorescence is the ratio of
the signals on the fluorescence and incident ion chambers is only true
in the limit of very thin samples or very dilute samples.  For thick,
concentrated samples, the depth into which the incident beam can
penetrate changes as fine structure of [% mu %] changes.  As the
oscillatory part wiggles up, the penetration depth diminishes.  As it
wiggles down, the depth increases.  This serves to attenuate the
oscillatory structure.

Ideally, all your samples that must be measured in fluorescence should
be either sufficiently thin or sufficiently dilute that your data is
unaffected by this self-absorption effect.  Sometimes, the constraints
of the sample are such that self-absorption cannot be avoided.  In
that case, you need to figure out what to do at the level of the data
analysis to find the correct answer in the face of this problem.  One
solution is presented here.

The self-absorption correction dialog offers four different algorithms
to approximate the effect of self-absorption using tables of x-ray
absorption coefficients.  One of them works on XANES data, while all
four can be used to correct EXAFS data.  One of the algorithms works
well for samples that are not in the infinitely thick limit.  These
various algorithms are taken from the available literature and are
offered to allow you to compare.

The example I show here are particularly well suited to this sort of
correction.  In both cases, we have a way to evaluate the success of
the correction.  In general, it can be difficult to guarantee the
success of the correction, particularly if the entire composition of
the sample is not well known.  That means that, in practice, this sort
of correction is not always useful.  But when it is, it's very useful
indeed.

It is also important to understand that the self-absorption effect
only effects the amplitude of your EXAFS data, not the phase.  Thus
even if you are unable to properly correct, you can still analyze your
EXAFS data for bond lengths.

In this example of correcting XANES data, ammonium sulfate was
dissolved in water at three different molarities: 0.1, 0.47, and
0.94.  The correction algorithm requires a complete description of the
sample, so we need to determine the ratio of water to ammonium sulfate.

1 amu = 1.6605 x 10^-27 kg

1 mole = 6.0221 x 10^23 particles

1 water molecule is 18 amu = 2.988 x 10^-26 kg

1 mole of water is .01800 kg

1 liter of water = 1 kg water, so 1 liter is 55.5555 moles

Adjusted for the density change upon adding the solute, there are
about 54.8 moles of water in the solution

After selecting an algorithm, you can use the other controls to enter
the incident and outgoing angles in degree and the thickness of the
sample in microns.  All algorithms require that you specify the
formula of the sample with stoichiometries in atomic percent.

These two data groups were measured from the same thin copper foil,
one in transmission and the other in fluorescence.  These data were
provided by Corwin Booth and are the data from the paper where he and
Bud Bridges presented their algorithm.

Since this is a thin film, only the Booth algorithm is appropriate.
(Although you might want to compare it to the other algorithms, if
only to see how the others overestimate the size of the correction due
to the fact that they do not consider film thickness.)

The formula for copper is Cu and Corwin reports that the thickness of
the sample is 4.6, the incident was 49 degrees and the outgoing angle
was 41 degrees.  Enter these values and plot the correction.  Save the
corrected data group and compare it to the transmission data, as shown
in [% INCLUDE imageref text="the plot below" label="selfabs_boothplot" %].

There are several things that can effect the comparison of the
corrected fluorescence data and the transmission data.  These include
how the two data sets were normalized, the incident and outgoing
angles, and the thickness.  Try changing all those things to see how
they effect the correction.

[% PROCESS section label="Information depth" %]

[% FILTER html_para %]

For any sample, you can plot the information depth as a function of
wavenumber.  This quantity was defined by Troger et al. and represents
the depth into the sample probed by the incident beam for a given
sample geometry as a function of energy.  In that depth, 68 percent of
the incident photons are absorbed and 68 percent of the fluorescence
photons are generated.  The information depth provides a useful metric
for whether a film sample can be considered [% INCLUDE font/quote
