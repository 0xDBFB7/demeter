[% FILTER html_para %]
Sadly, most data that we measure is, frankly, kind of crappy.  A
single scan typically ranges from noisy to so dominated by noise that
it's hard to recognize it as oscillatory.  Fortunately, the central
limit theorem works every single time.  If you add up enough noisy
scans, it eventually turns into real data!

All entries in the group list which are marked will be included in the
merge.  Make sure that the marked groups really are the ones you want
to include in the merge!

Data can be merged as [% mu %], normalized [% mu %], or [% chik %].
In most cases, it makes little difference which one you choose.
[% chir %] will be the same regardless.  (This can be tested, in fact,
I encourage you to do so.)  The standard deviation in the merged data
is also computed and stays with the data in project and certain output
files, although [% athena %] does nothing else with the standard
deviation other than plotting it, which is shown
[% INCLUDE imageref text="below" label="merge_stddev" in=1 %].

By default, each data set is weighted the same in the merge.  You can
specify the weight to use for each data set using the
[% PROCESS font/param a="importance" %] parameter, which is 1 by
default for ever group.  Alternately, you can let [% ifeffit %]
determine the amount of noise in the data by looking at the signal
between 15 and 25 in R-space and then use the noise to weight the
data.  In that way, cleaner data contributes more to the merge.  The
choice between using the noise or the [% PROCESS font/param a="importance" %]
is made using the check buttons in the menu.

[% FILTER html_para %]
The data merging feature is one of [% athena %]'s most important.  My
typical work pattern is to carefully align scans on a sample, merge
them, then analyze the merged data in [% artemis %].
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER html/caution %]
It is essential that your data be well-aligned before merging.
Merging poorly aligned data has the effect of significant attenuating
the fine structure.
[% END %]

[% FILTER html_para %]
When merging as [% mu %] or normalized [% mu %], if every data group
included in the merge has a reference channel, the reference channels
will also be merged and these two merged spectra will be tied together
as
[% INCLUDE html/link text="a reference channels"
                     link="../import/ref.html" %].  
Thus the merge of the reference channels can serve as the alignment
standard for the merge of the data.

There is one situation where merging as [% mu %] will be substantively
different from the other two options.  If something happens to change
the values of the signals on the detectors in such a way that [% mu %]
for subsequent scans is of very different sizes but the normalized
[% mu %] data is consistent for all the data, then the merge in [% mu %]
will be dominated by the scans with larger absolute values while the
merge in normalized [% mu %] will treat all the data with similar
weights.  One way of having this happen is to change amplifier gains
between scans.  In that situation, you probably should choose to merge
normalized or [% chik %] data.
