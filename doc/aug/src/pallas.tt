text="Gustav Klimt" %] was a prominent Austrian symbolist from the
turn of the 20th century.  His work remains widely popular almost a
century after his death, due as much to its sensuality and eroticism
as to the fact that his vision remain vibrant and relevant even in
today's highly visual and media-drenched society.

Mythological imagery was a frequent topic of Klimt's oeuvre.  I find
the glaring eyes and stiff, powerful stance of his Athena to be quite
compelling.  I love the juxtaposition of the classical Greek figure in
the background with the vaguely Asiatic face on her breastplate.
