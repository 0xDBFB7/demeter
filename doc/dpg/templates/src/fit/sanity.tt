[% META title = 'Sanity checking the fitting model' %]

[% FILTER html_para %]
A lot happens under the hood when the [% INCLUDE font/mono a='fit' %]
method is called by a Fit object.  One of the first things that
happens is an extensive series of sanity checks on the objects that
make up the fitting model.

Here is the complete list of tests that are made on a fitting model:
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER html/list type="ol" %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
If Data objects read directly from a column data file (rather than
from, say, an [% athena %] project file, all such  data files included
in the fit must exist. 
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
If Path objects read directly from  [% INCLUDE font/file
a="feffNNNN.dat" %] files, all such files used in the fit must exist.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
All guess parameters are used in at least one def parameter or path
parameter.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
No def or path parameters use parameters which have not been defined.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Binary operators are used correctly.  This test specifically checks
that none of these strings appear in a math expression:
[% WRAPPER html/pre %]
   ++    --   //   ***   ^^
[% END %]
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
All [% ifeffit %] function names (i.e. strings that are followed by an
open paren) are valid [% ifeffit %] functions.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
All data and path objects have unique [% INCLUDE font/mono a='group' %]
attributes.  (It is possible for a user to reset this attribute, although
this is considered very bad practice.) 
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
All GDS parameters have unique names.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
All opening parens are matched by closing parens.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Data attribute related to fitting make sense, for example that 
[% INCLUDE font/mono a='fft_kmin' %] is
smaller than [% INCLUDE font/mono a='fft_kmax' %].
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
The number of guess parameters does not exceed the number of
independent points.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
The [% INCLUDE font/mono a='bft_rmin' %] value is not greater than 
[% INCLUDE font/mono a='bkg_rbkg' %].
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
The [% reff %] of any path is not very far beyond
[% INCLUDE font/mono a='bft_rmax' %].
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
[% ifeffit %]'s hardwired limits on things like the maximum number of guess
parameters and the maximum number of data sets are not exceeded by the
fitting model.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
No GDS parameters have the names of [% ifeffit %] program variables or other
reserved words.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
No merge parameters remain unresolved.  Merge parameters are GDS
parameters that are in naming conflict in a project that involves
importing structural units or otherwise merging together elements of a
fitting model. As of version 0.4, this is an unimplemented feature. 
[% END %]
[% END %]

[% FILTER html_para %]
If any of these sanity checks fail for your fitting model, the fit
will not continue and a (hopefully) useful error message will be
issued via [% demeter %]'s error reporting system.  For a script run
at the command line, this error message is typically (and by default)
issued to STDERR.  For a Wx application, the warning text will
normally be displayed in a dialog box or elsewhere.  Disposal of the
error text is left as a chore for the end-user application.

There are, as of version 0.4, several missing tests, including:
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER html/list type="ol" %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Test that every included Data object has at least 1 Path object
associated with it. 
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Test that every Path object is associated with a Data object.  This
should be a warning, not an error.  The unassociated Path can simply
be ignored.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Test that each Data in the data array is properly defined.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Test that every Path points either to a ScatteringPath object or to a
real path file.
[% END %]
[% WRAPPER html/li %]
Test that no def parameters are [% INCLUDE font/quote a='self-referential' %],
i.e. something like 
[% WRAPPER html/pre %]
def a = 5*a
[% END %]
Here's a quiz: in [% ifeffit %] what get printed to the screen if you
do this?
[% WRAPPER html/pre %]
def a = 1
def a = 5*a
print a
[% END %]
Try it.  The answer may surprise you.  The reason for the value it
takes is that [% ifeffit %] re-evaluates def parameters 3 times to
deal with ordering problems in the parameter definitions.  This works
well for non-circular definitions, but oddly for examples like that one.
Testing for circularity among two or more parameters is  also necessary,
albeit more challenging.
[% END %]
[% END %]

[% WRAPPER html/todo %]
Implement missing sanity checks.
[% END %]
