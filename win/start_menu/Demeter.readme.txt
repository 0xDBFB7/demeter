Demeter with Strawberry Perl

You have just installed Bruce Ravel's Demeter package, which includes
the graphical inerfaces Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus.  Demeter is a
tool for building XAS analysis programs using Feff and Ifeffit.  It
written in the Perl programming language and makes use of many tools
from the CPAN library -- most notably Moose and Wx.  It uses other
free and freely available software tools, most notably Gnuplot.

If this is your first time installing Demeter, please be patient the
first time you make a plot with one of the programs.  The first plot
made wih Gnuplot on your computer may be quite slow, but all
subsequent plots will be speedy.
