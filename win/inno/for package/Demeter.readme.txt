Demeter with Strawberry Perl

You have just installed Bruce Ravel's Demeter package, which includes
the graphical inerfaces Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus.  Demeter is a
tool for building XAS analysis programs using Feff and Ifeffit and is
the tool from which Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus are built.

If this is your first time installing Demeter: 
  *** Please be patient the first time you make a plot with one
  *** of the programs.  The first plot made wih Gnuplot on your
  *** computer may be quite slow, but all subsequent plots will
  *** be speedy.
