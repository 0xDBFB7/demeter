These are notes on building a Demeter build environment from scratch.

* Strawberry

Start by grabbing the latest and greatest from
http://strwaberryperl.com.  This has a decent selection of MinGW
cooked right in, so many things will be buildable immediately.

* mingw

 + start from scratch to avoid conflict with what's in Strawberry.
   download from http://www.mingw.org
 + install mingw32-base and msys-base
 + do not install fortran -- it comes with Strawberry

* pgplot

 + from http://spdg1.sci.shizuoka.ac.jp/grwinlib/english/ download the
   GrWinC toolkit.  unpack it.  Do not install one of the "prebuilt"
   packages.  I have no idea what they are for.
 + at the top of the toolkit, unpack the pgplot package from
   http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot/.  This will make a folder
   called ~pgplot~ at top of the toolkit.
 + Move the stuff from the PATCH folder into the appropriate places in
   ~pgplot~. 
 + cd to ~build/MinGw-gfortran~.  The Makefile should just run at this
   point. 
 + make a folder in ~C:\strawberry\c\lib\~ called ~pgplot~.  Move the
   following there
    1. grfont.dat  
    2. libCalcomp.a
    3. libGrWin.a
    4. libGrWin0.a
    5. libcpgplot.a
    6. libpgplot.a
    7. rgb.txt
 + You can now compile ifeffit
   
Are any of the executable from GrWin needed?

* GnuWin32

 + from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages.html install the
   packages for PdCurses and Readline.  These will be installed into
   ~C:\GnuWin32~

 + grab all file from ~C:\GnuWin32\lib~ with "curses", "readline", or
   "history" in the file name.  Copy them to ~C:\strawberry\c\lib~ 

 + from ~C:\GnuWin32\bin~, copy ~readline5.dll~ and ~curses2.dll~ to
   ~C:\strawberry\c\bin~   


* compiling Ifeffit

 + Replace ~iconf_pgplot~, ~iconf_term~, and ~iconf_iff~ with the
   versions from ~win/~ in the Demeter distribution 

 + Modify line 85 of the main Makefile.in to read 
   :  SUBDIRS = src
   (i.e. remove ~readline~ so it does not get compiled.)

 + Modify line 90 in ~src/cmdline/Makefile.in~ to read 
   :  readline_LIB =   $(TERMCAP_LIB)

 + ~./configure --prefix='/c/strawberry/c~  (Note: this should be done
   in the MinGW window and *not* in the Windows command prompt.) 

 + Edit ~src/lib/sys.h~, changing the ~sysdir~ and ~pgdev~ lines like so:
   :  c{sys.h  -*-fortran-*- 
   :  c system and build specific stuff goes here
   :  c to be included in iff_config.f
   :         sysdir = 'C:\strawberry\c\share\ifeffit'
   :         pgdev  = '/gw'
   :         inifile= 'startup.iff  .ifeffit'
   :         build = '1.2.11d'//
   :       $   ' Copyright (c) 2008 Matt Newville, Univ of Chicago'
   :  c}
   Note that this somewhat changes how the Ifeffit build procedure
   works.  By setting the prefix at configuration time to be different
   from the ~sysdir~, Ifeffit will get installed into Strawberry.

 + Edit ~iconf_pgplot~ to change ~-lg2c~ to ~-lgfortran~

 + Do 
   : ./configure --prefix='/c/strawberry/c'
   note the unix style delimiters.

 + Now ~make~ and ~make install~ 

 + The demeter installer sets a couple of environment variables, which
   may need to be set by hand to test while building
    1. PGPLOT_DIR to ~C:\strawberry\c\lib\pgplot~
    2. FONTCONFIG_FILE to ~C:\strawberry\c\bin\etc\fonts\fonts.conf~


* Gnuplot

 + grab the gnuplot installer from the gnuplot download site
 + install to C:\strawberry\c\bin\gnuplot
 + the executables are in C:\strawberry\c\bin\gnuplot\bin (*this is
   different from previous versions of the installer!*)
 + for 0.9.19,
   * reset default windows executable to
     ~__PERL_BASE__\c\bin\gnuplot\bin\gnuplot.exe~
   * need to write some code to check for this and reset config value
     as needed


* using CPAN

 + o conf http_proxy http://192.168.1.130:3128
 + o conf ftp_proxy http://192.168.1.130:3128
 + o conf prerequisites_policy follow
 + o conf commit

At this point ~Build installdeps~ should run.

Is MooseX::Singleton necessary?  Nope!  Removed it from the
dependency list!

* Demeter, prerequisites

 + clone or pull latest
 + perl Build.PL
 + perl Build installdeps
 + wait...
 + wait...
 + wait...
 + on the first pass through, the following 4 (not bad!) did not
   install cleanly
    1. Archive::Zip >= 1.31 (Strawberry comes with 1.30)
    2. PDL::Stats
    3. Syntax::Highlight::Perl
    4. File::Monitor::Lite
 + from the DOS command line, run cpan.bat
    1. A::Z failed a test having someting to do with writing to a place
       without adequate permission.  seems safe to ~force install Archive::Zip~
    2. P::S does not fail, it's unclear to me why it did not install
       earlier.  installed simply with ~install PDL::Stats~
    3. S::H::P (build) failed to unarchive cleanly.  Need to
       investigate.  This is a very simple module.  Can easily install
       by hand, if need be.
    4. F::M::L (recommended) failed tests all involve incorrect
       handling of path delimiters on Windows.  seems safe to ~force
       install File ::Monitor::Lite~

* Demeter, build
