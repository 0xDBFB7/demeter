LCF fit of {$S->data->name} as {$S->space_description} from {$S->xmin} to {$S->xmax}

Fit included {$S->npoints} data points and {$S->nvarys} variables
Weights sum to 1: {$S->yesno($S->unity)}
Weights forced between 0 and 1: {$S->yesno($S->inclusive)}
Overall e0 shift used: {$S->yesno($S->one_e0)}
Linear term added: {$S->yesno($S->linear)}

R-factor = {$S->rfactor}
Chi-square = {$S->chisqr}
Reduced chi-square = {$S->chinu}
