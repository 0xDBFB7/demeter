This folder contains various tools that might be useful interacting
with Demeter.

Emacs-lisp files
================

The can be used with Emacs or XEmacs.

config-mode.el:       major mode for editing Demeter configuration files
ifeffit-mode.el:      major mode for editing Ifeffit scripts
demeter-skeletons.el: skeleton and abbrev definitions to help write Demeter perl scripts
		      see the comments in the header for using this


Patches
=======

If you are unable to duild and install PDL::Stats, as discussed at
http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2015-August/012679.html,
do the following:

 1. Download PDL::Stats from https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Stats

 2. Unpack the tarball and cd into its directory

 3. Copy `glm.patch' from Demeter's tools directory into the new
    PDL::Stats directory

 4. Apply `glm.patch' by issuing this command:
      patch -p0 < glm.patch

 5. Build and install PDL::Stats by doing
      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install # or sudo make install


Personal Demeter templates
==========================

The file cumulant_order.zip shows an example of how to define and use
personal templates which override the standard templates provided with
Demeter.  This example shows how to write the columns of path
parameter evaluations in an EXAFS fit log file in order of increasing
cumulant order.  (The default is to organize the columns such that
commonly correlated parameters are next to one another and the less
common parameters are in the second list.)

To use these, unzip this file in ~/.horae (unix) or %APPDATA%\demeter
(windows) and put something like the following in a script:

    $fit->set_mode(template_report=>'order');

That will cause Demeter to format the path parameter columns according
to these templates rather than the default one.
