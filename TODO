* Artemis: polishing for beta release

** TODO Figure out seg fault problem

** TODO Cut and paste is wonky in GDS grid

** Atoms/Feff
*** TODO Rename Atoms/Feff calculation

*** [4/4] Import external Feff calculation
 - [X] import atoms or feff + rest of calculation
 - [X] deal with missing phase.bin
 - [X] deal with missing feffNNNN.dat (i.e. just importing feff.inp)
 - [X] how to disable a tab?  disable Atoms tab if atoms file is missing

*** DONE Import a feff.inp file alone via Feff calc add button


** Projects
*** [6/6] Import feffit.inp
 - [X] Basic import
 - [X] Exception handling for ambiguous feff.inp file
 - [X] Exception handling for incomplete feff calc.
 - [X] +Trim number of scattering paths+
 - [X] +What about local params?+
 - [X] Can't find data, can't find feffNNNN ...?

*** TODO Better *sensitivity* to when a project needs saving  :Project:

*** TODO Saving incomplete projects

** Plotting
*** DONE autoplot kq after fit does not seem to be working
*** DONE window check button sometimes ignored
*** DONE Use stack data sets offset		:MDS:

** Data
*** DONE Import chi(k) ascii data directly
*** DONE Make sure everything works for MDS fitting :MDS:
*** DONE Click new data button, immediately cancel --> crash!

** [2/3] Column data export
  - [X] Save marked paths as k0 k1 k2 k3 rm rr ri qm qr qi
  - [X] Save this data as + fit, bkg, residual, running, window
  - [ ] Save plotting list as k r q

** [1/2] Plotting list functionality
  - [X] Right click functionality
  - [ ] Save plot to a file

* Artemis: bigger features

** History

** After beta release
  1. Balance interstitial energies for MFC fits  :MFC:
  2. Use structural units
  3. Use arbitrary MS paths (really?)
  4. Use nearly collinear paths
  5. Import mutiple data sets from an Athena project file  :MDS:FitSequence:
  6. Reorganize lists, move individual items up and down, move blocks
     up and down
      - Path list
      - Plot list
  7. Clone data sets such that the path list gets replicated
     efficiently (i.e. for MDS fits)
  8. VPaths to project file  :Project:
  9. Indicators to project file  :Project:

* Demeter

** [11/11] Special file types
 - [X] X23A2MED
 - [X] X15B
 - [X] X10C
 - [X] HXMA
 - [X] SSRL ASCII
 - [X] SSRL binary 
 - [X] SSRL micro
 - [X] CMC, 9BM
 - [X] Photon Factory BL12C
 - [X] Lytle database with encoder values
 - [X] DUBBLE

** DONE import chi(k) data on the improper grid

** TODO Structural Units
Extension of VPath.  Store GDS, feff, and path objects in a zip file.
On import, mark GDS parameters as merge if in conflict

** TODO MSPaths
Much like SSPath, make an arbitrary n-legged path

** TODO Nearly collinear paths
Define a three body configuration, generate its 4-legged path and a
sequence of three-legged paths along with a mixing parameter.

It will take a single set of path parameters that are pushed onto the
generated Path objects, except for the amplitude, which will be
computed from the mixing parameter.

This is a single object for the user to interact with which expands
into 2 or 3 3-legged paths and a single 4-legged path

** DONE What's up with cloning Atoms object?
+See [[file:examples/recipes/MixedShell/abc.pl][MixedShell recipe]]
This might be fixed after recent work on cloning+  /yessiree/

** TODO Current plot to column data file

** TODO Demeter command backend needs polishing

** TODO feffit.inp import: MDS that is not meerely MKW




------
* Windows
** TODO non-ascii symbols
** TODO Fix [[file:lib/Demeter/UI/Wx/CheckListBook.pm][CheckListBook]]
** test, test, test ....
