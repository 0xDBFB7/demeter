* Artemis: polishing for beta release

** TODO Cut and paste is wonky in GDS grid

** Atoms/Feff
*** TODO Rename Atoms/Feff calculation

*** [1/4] Import external Feff calculation
 - [X] import atoms or feff + rest of calculation
 - [ ] deal with missing phase.bin
 - [ ] deal with missing feffNNNN.dat (i.e. just importing feff.inp)
 - [ ] how to disable a tab?  disable Atoms tab if atoms file is missing

*** TODO Import a feff.inp file alone via Feff calc add button


** Projects
*** TODO Import feffit.inp
Need to [[Import%20external%20Feff%20calculation][import external]] feff calc. gracefully in order to do this
Demeter::Feff:Feffit currently converts feffit.inp into a Fit object
using file/folder attributes.  Instead, it needs to import the
external Feff calculations.  That means that checks for completeness
of the external Feff calculation must be robust.

*** TODO Better *sensitivity* to when a project needs saving

*** TODO Saving incomplete projects

** Plotting
*** DONE autoplot kq after fit does not seem to be working
*** DONE window check button sometimes ignored
*** TODO Use stack data sets offset  :MDS:

** Data
*** DONE Import chi(k) ascii data directly
*** TODO Make sure everything works for MDS fitting :MDS:
*** TODO Click new data button, immediately cancel --> crash!

--------

* Artemis: bigger features

** History

** TODO After beta release
  1. Balance interstitial energies
  2. Use structural units
  3. Use arbitrary MS paths
  4. Use nearly collinear paths
  5. Import mutiple data sets from an Athena project file
  6. Reorganize lists, move individuual items up and down, move blocks
     up and down
      - Path list
      - Plot list

* Demeter

** [10/10] Special file types
 - [X] X23A2MED
 - [X] X15B
 - [X] X10C
 - [X] HXMA
 - [X] SSRL ASCII
 - [X] SSRL binary 
 - [X] SSRL micro
 - [X] CMC, 9BM
 - [X] Photon Factory BL12C
 - [X] Lytle database with encoder values

** DONE import chi(k) data on the improper grid

** TODO Structural Units
Extension of VPath.  Store GDS, feff, and path objects in a zip file.
On import, mark GDS parameters as merge if in conflict

** TODO MSPaths
Much like SSPath, make an arbitrary n-legged path

** TODO Nearly collinear paths
Define a three body configuration, generate its 4-legged path and a
sequence of three-legged paths along with a mixing parameter.

It will take a single set of path parameters that are pushed onto the
generated Path objects, except for the amplitude, which will be
computed from the mixing parameter.

This is a single object for the user to interact with which expands
into 2 or 3 3-legged paths and a single 4-legged path

** DONE What's up with cloning Atoms object?
+See [[file:examples/recipes/MixedShell/abc.pl][MixedShell recipe]]
This might be fixed after recent work on cloning+  /yessiree/

** TODO Current plot to column data file

** TODO Demeter command backend needs polishing






------
* Windows
** TODO non-ascii symbols
** TODO Fix [[file:lib/Demeter/UI/Wx/CheckListBook.pm][CheckListBook]]
** test, test, test ....
