Demeter to do list [2009-12-24 Thu]

* Artemis

** TODO Cut and paste is wonky in GDS grid
** TODO Reorganize path list, up, down
 - [ ] up
 - [ ] down

** Atoms/Feff
*** TODO Rename Atoms/Feff calculation
*** TODO Import external Feff calculation
*** TODO Balance interstitial energies

** Projects
*** TODO Import feffit.inp
Need to import external feff calc. gracefully in order to do this
*** TODO Better *sensitivity* to when a project needs saving

** Plotting
*** TODO autoplot kq after fit does not seem to be working
*** TODO Use stack data sets offset
*** TODO reorder plot list

** Data
*** TODO Import chi(k) ascii data directly
*** TODO Import mutiple data sets from an Athena project file
*** TODO Make sure everything works for MDS fitting


* Demeter

** [0/7] Special file types
 - [ ] X23A2MED
 - [ ] X15B
 - [ ] X10C
 - [ ] HXMA
 - [ ] SSRL binary and micro
 - [ ] CMC, 9BM
 - [ ] Photon Factory BL12C


** TODO Structural Units
Extension of VPath.  Store GDS, feff, and path objects in a zip file.
On import, mark GDS parameters as merge if in conflict

** TODO MSPaths
Much like SSPath, make an arbitrary n-legged path

** TODO Nearly collinear paths
Define a three body configuration, generate its 4-legged path and a
sequence of three-legged paths along with a mixing parameter.

It will take a single set of path parameters that are pushed onto the
generated Path objects, except for the amplitude, which will be
computed from the mixing parameter.

This is a single object for the user to interact with which expands
into 2 or 3 3-legged paths and a single 4-legged path

** TODO What's up with cloning Atoms object? See [[file:examples/recipes/MixedShell/abc.pl][MixedShell recipe]]
This might be fixed after recent work on cloning

** TODO Current plot to column data file

** TODO Demeter command backend needs polishing

* Windows
** TODO non-ascii symbols
** TODO [[file:lib/Demeter/UI/Wx/CheckListBook.pm][CheckListBook]]
** test, test, test ....
