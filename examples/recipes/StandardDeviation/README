This example demonstrates the use of merged Data groups and the
standard deviation array.  In the short script in this directory,
three iron foil scans are imported, then a merged Data group is made
from them.  Three ways of visualizing the merge are then shown:

 1. Plot the merge along with the data that went into the merge

 2. Plot the data along with the data +/- the standard deviation.
    This plots a sort of error margin around the data.

 3. Plot the data along with the standard deviation array.  The
    standard deviation is scaled up to plot on the scale as the data.
    This kind of plot shows the distribution of the standard deviation
    across the data -- it is usually largest near the edge.
