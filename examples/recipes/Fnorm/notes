I am VERY pleased that you would like to implement the energy dependent normalization in Athena!

I enclose an Athena file with some files:

"S_mirr_nodet_2ave_corr.txt" is a spectrum of pure sulfur deposited on a
membrane collected in transmission mode.  So let's say that the
oscillations have the "correct" intensities.  I know that this may not
be completely true given that making a sample of sulfur for
transmission mode is not straightforward. It took me a morning of
trial and error.  Anyway, I fitted the first shell and the values of
the best fit make sense, so I have assumed that this spectrum is a
good reference

"VST1-LiTDI_000.corr" is the initial spectrum of the discharge cycle of
the battery, taken at the back side of the cathode. So it is pure
sulfur, but is in fluorescence mode.

"VST1-LiTDI_000norm.dat" is the same spectrum with the energy dependent
calibration.

The other two couples of files : "VST1-LiTDI_nnn.corr" and
"VST1-LiTDI_nnnnorm.dat" are spectra along the discharge cycle without
and with the energy dependent normalization.
