* Filenames with non-ascii characters

The files in this directory are copies of =../fe.060= with names
changed to use different character sets.

The file names are not necessarily meaningful.  They are chosen to
demonstrate and test Athena's response to such files.  Many of these
examples use words I copied and pasted from a [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2309215/how-can-i-substitute-unicode-characters-with-ascii-in-perl][Stack Overflow post]]
about [[https://metacpan.org/pod/Text::Unidecode][Text::Unidecode]].
