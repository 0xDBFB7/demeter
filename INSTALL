Installing prerequisites
========================

1. Ifeffit:

   Download Ifeffit from http://cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit/Downloads
   Unpack the tarball, cd into the new directory, then

    a. Install PGPLOT:

         sudo ./PGPLOT_install

    b. Install Ifeffit:

         ./configure
         make
         sudo make install

2. Libperlxray:

   Next, you need to install several of Bruce's perl projects that are
   not packaged with Demeter:

   Download libperlxray using subversion

     svn co http://cars9.uchicago.edu/svn/libperlxray/ libperlxray

     a. cd into libperlxray/Ifeffit and do

         perl Makefile.PL
	 make
	 sudo make install
	 
     b. cd into libperlxray/Absorption and do

         perl Build.PL
	 sudo ./Build installdeps
	 ./Build
	 sudo ./Build install

     c. cd into libperlxray/Formula and do

         perl Build.PL
	 sudo ./Build installdeps
	 ./Build
	 sudo ./Build install

Installing Demeter
==================

Download libperlxray using subversion

   svn co http://cars9.uchicago.edu/svn/demeter/trunk demeter

cd into the demeter directory and do

   perl Build.PL
   sudo ./Build installdeps
   sudo cpanp -i Regexp::Optimizer --force
   ./Build
   sudo ./Build install

The "installdeps" step will be *very* time consuming as it installs
several large packages that are required by Demeter.  the following
step is necessary because, for some reason, the Regexp::Optimizer
module always fails to install correctly.  That step will force its
installation.
