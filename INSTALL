Demeter should now be completely independent of Horae, with all common
functionality placed in libperlxray. You can now install Horae and
Demeter separately or together, as you wish.

To successfully install Demeter, you need a C compiler.

In the directory where you checked out Demeter, issue this command to
install all the CPAN prerequisites:

  sudo ./install_prereqs

or become root and run the install_prereqs script.

Answer yes to any questions you are asked.

Once that has completed successfully, do the standard perl
installation incantation:

  perl Build.PL
  ./Build
  sudo ./Build install

or become root to run the last step.
