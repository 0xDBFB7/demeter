<h1>
  The Paths tab
</h1>

<p>
When you click the &ldquo;Run Feff&rdquo; button on
the <span class=program>FEFF</span> tab, the <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation is run.  Once finished, a
succinct summary of the calculation is displayed on the Paths tab.
</p>


<a href="../../images/feff.paths.png" target=_blank><img class=flexy src="../../images/feff.paths.png" title="
The Paths tab.
" alt="
The Paths tab.
"></a>

<p>
Some statistics about the <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation are shown in the
Description text box.  Below that is the summary of the paths found in
the <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation.  This summary is presented in the form of a
table.  Each row describes a scattering path.
</p>

<p>
The first column shows the degeneracy of the path.  The second column
shows its nominal path length, R<sub>eff</sub>.  That is value that will be
used in any 
<a href="../path/mathexp.html">path parameter math expression</a>
containing the 
<tt>reff</tt> token.
</p>

<p>
The third column shows a simple view of the scattering path.  The 
<tt>@</tt> token represents the absorber, thus
appears as  the first and last token in each description.  The tokens
representing the scattering atoms are taken from the tags on the
<span class=program>FEFF</span> tab.  You can change the absorber token by setting the
<span class=pref>&diams;Pathfinder&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;token</span>
configuration parameter.
</p>

<p>
The fourth column contains the rank of the path.  This is an attempt
to predict how important of each path will be to your fitting model.
Paths with large spectral weight have a large rank and paths with
little spectral weight have small rank.  Highly ranked paths are
colored <span style="color:#046a15; background-color:white">green</span>, mid-rank
paths are colored <span style="color:#78670e; background-color:white">yellow</span>,
and low-rank paths are <span style="color:#787878; background-color:white">grey</span>.
</p>

<p>
Don't  put too much faith in this assessment of importance.  You
should explicitly check all paths to decide if they should be included
in a fit.
</p>

<p>
Currently, there is only one scheme for assigning path ranks.  The
curved-wave importance factors from <span class=program>FEFF6</span> are used.  These are
rather unreliable as they are computed using a very crude algorithm.
Future versions of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> will offer several path ranking schemes
to improve upon <span class=program>FEFF</span>'s[$#'%] simple algorithm.
</p>

<p>
The fifth column gives the number of legs in each path.  The final
column is a simple explanation of the shape of the scattering
geometry.
</p>

<p>
The rows in this table are selectable by mouse click.  Left clicking
on a row selects that row.  Control clicking on another row adds it to
the selection.  Shift clicking adds to the selection all rows between
the one clicked upon and the previously clicked upon row.
</p>

<p>
Much of the functionality of this page rests upon the set of selected
paths.  Most importantly, selecting paths is the first step to using
paths in a fitting model.  This will be explained in the 
<a href="../path/index.html">next chapter</a>.
</p>

<p>
At the top of the Paths tab are a series of buttons.  The 
&ldquo;Save&rdquo; button will write the entire
<span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation to a form that can be reimported into <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>
or used in some other context in a <span class=program>DEMETER</span> script.  The remaining
buttons are related to making plots of the selected paths.
</p>

A plot of paths from the raw <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation.  In this example, the
first three single scattering paths from the sodium uranyl triacetate
calculation were selected along with a low-rank multiple scattering
path.  Then the &ldquo;Plot selection&rdquo; button was
pressed.  In this plot, we see that the three single scattering
paths are, indeed, quite large.  The multiple scattering path can
barely be seen on this scale.  It truly is a low importance path.
</p>

<p>
The meaning of a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation
is that it is displayed as &chi;(k) with S&sup2;&#8320; set to 1.0 and each
of E&#8320;, &Delta;R, and &sigma;&sup2; set to 0.  A plot of &chi;(R) for
the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation, then,
displays the Foruier transform of &chi;(k) parameterized with those
values.
</p>

<p>
It is, therefore, very quick and easy to examine the results of a
<span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation.  The other four buttons are used to select how
the plot of paths is made.  The options are &chi;(k), |&chi;(R)|,
Re[&chi;(R)], and Im[&chi;(R)].  The k-weight selected in the Plot
window is used to make the plot of paths.
</p>

<p>
Right clicking on an entry in the paths list will open a dialog window
with more details about the geomtery of the scattering path.  In the
following figure, the selected path (#0006) was right-clicked on,
opening the dialog depicted below.
