<h1>
  The Atoms and Feff Window
</h1>

<p>
When you import crystal data from an <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> or CIF file, three things happen:
</p>


<ol>
  
<li><p>
A new <span class=program>ATOMS</span> and <span class=program>FEFF</span> window is created for interacting with
the structural data and 
the various controls are set to values taken from the
<span class=file>atoms.inp</span> or CIF file, 
</p></li>
<li><p>
A message is written to the status bar in the Main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>
An entry is placed in the <span class=program>FEFF</span> list on the main window.
</p></li>
</ol> 

<p>
You can also import a <span class=file>feff.inp</span> file
directly.  This is discussed in the
<a href="../feff/feff.html">next section</a>
</p>

<p>
This new window looks like this.  In this example, crystal data for
anatase TiO<sub>2</sub> have been imported from an
<span class=file>atoms.inp</span> file.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 623px; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=feff-atoms>
<img src=../../images/feff-atoms.png width=100%>
</a>
<p align=center>
The <span class=program>ATOMS</span> and <span class=program>FEFF</span> window in <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
At the top of the window is a tool bar with four buttons.  The first
of these is used to change the name of this <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation.
Among other things, this is the label used in the <span class=program>FEFF</span> list on the
Main window.  The second button is used to discard the <span class=program>FEFF</span>
calculation and this window.  The final two buttons open a web
browser and take you either to the <span class=program>FEFF</span> document or to this page
in the <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> document.
</p>

<p>
There are a series of tabs across the top.  These will contain
different stages of the structural calculation.  Here we will examine
the <span class=program>ATOMS</span> tab.  The other tabs will be examined in the following
sections.
</p>



<hr class=hide />
<a name="crystaldata">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h2>  Crystal data</h2>

<p>
The crystal cell data &ndash; including lattice constants and angles, the
space group symbol, and the elements of the shift vector &ndash; are placed in
text boxes for easy editing.  The coordinates of the unique sites are
listed in the grid at the bottom of the window.  The absorber is
chosen by clicking one of the boxes on the 
<tt>Core</tt> column.
</p>

<p>
Remember that <span class=program>FEFF</span> considers numbers with 5 digits of precision
after the decimal point.  <tt>0.333</tt> is not the
same thing as <tt>0.33333</tt>.  You may, however,
enter things like <tt>1/3</tt> and avoid the
precision issue entirely.
</p>

<p>
As a new feature compared to earlier versions of <span class=program>ATOMS</span>, there are
two radial distances.  The cluster size determines the extent of the
cluster expanded into the <span class=file>feff.inp</span>.  This
should usually be set to something rather large, 9 &Aring; is often a
good default.  This probably (but not always!) assures that the
cluster in the <span class=file>feff.inp</span> file is adequately
large to include all unique potentials and has all atom types
sufficiently well bounded that the muffin tin potentials are likely to
be be computed reasonably well.
</p>

<p>
The second distance will set the value of <tt>RMAX</tt> in the <span class=file>feff.inp</span> file.  In
general, you do not want this to be much larger than the extent of the
data you intend to analyze.  5 &Aring; or 6 &Aring; is usually the
largest sensible value for longest path.  The reason for this is that
the pathfinder part of <span class=program>FEFF</span> has been rewritten for this version
of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.  While the new pathfinder implementation offers a
number of useful new features, it is substantially slower than
<span class=program>FEFF</span>'s  native pathfinder.  In any case, there is no
benefit to computing paths that you will never use in your fit.
</p>

<p>
The absorption edge for the calculation is chosen from the menu to the
left of the lattice constant area.  This is usually determined from
the input data, but may need to be explicitly selected.  If not
specified in the <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> file, the edge
will be set to K for element lighter than Ce (Z=58), and to L<sub>III</sub>
for heavier elements.
</p>

<p>
The style menu is another new feature in this version of Atoms.  It is
used to set how the list of unique potentials is determined from the
elements in the atoms list.  The choices are
</p>


<dl>
  
<dt>
  elements
</dt>
<dd>
Each unique element species is assigned a potential number.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd>
<dt>
  tags
</dt>
<dd>
Each unique tag is assigned a potential number.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd>
<dt>
  sites
</dt>
<dd>
Each crystallographic site is assigned a potential number.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd>
</dl> 

<p>
Remember that <span class=program>FEFF</span> only allows for 7 unique potentials other than
the absorber.  The tags and sites options can often result in more
than 7 potnatials, which will result in an unrunnable
<span class=file>feff.inp</span> file.  Specifying unique
potentials by tags is a good way of differentiating between dissimilar
atoms of the same species.  For example, in an oxygenyl species, it is
often useful to give the axial oxygen atoms a different potential from
the remaining oxygens by using the tags option.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example of an <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> file
for sodium uranyl acetate, which contains two very short axial oxygen
atoms double bonded to the uranium atoms at about 1.8 &Aring; and a
number of equatorial oxygen atoms at a much longer distance.  The
axial and equatorial oxygen positions are distinguished by their tags
and will given separate unique potentials when using the tags style.
</p>

<p>
The assignment of potential indeces is explained in detail and with
examples in the <a href="../extended/ipots.html">extended explanations chapter</a>.

<h2>  Atoms tool bar</h2>

<p>
The toolbar across the top of the <span class=program>ATOMS</span> tab offers several functions.
</p>

<p>
Clicking the open button will post the standard file selection dialog
for importing a new <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> or CIF file.
This is more useful in the stand-along version of <span class=program>ATOMS</span> than in
<span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> where the crystal data file imported in other ways.
<em>Right clicking</em> this button will post the
recent files dialog populated with recently imported 
<span class=file>atoms.inp</span>, 
<span class=file>feff.inp</span>, and CIF files.
</p>


<p>
<a class=floatleft href="../../images/feff-export.png" target=_blank><img border=0 src="../../images/feff-export.png"   alt="feff-export.png"></a>
The save button will prompt you for a filename for an output 
<span class=file>atoms.inp</span> saving the current state of the
tab.
</p>

<p>
Clicking the export button will post dialog on the right, which offers several
different kinds of output files based on the crystal data.
The &ldquo;Feff6&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feff8&rdquo; options will write input files for <span class=program>FEFF6</span> and
<span class=program>FEFF8</span>.  The &ldquo;Atoms&rdquo; option write the
same file as the save button.  The &ldquo;P1&rdquo;
option writes the cyrstal data using the <tt>P 1</tt> space group and with a fully decorated unit cell. The &ldquo;Spacegroup&rdquo; option writes a file that fully describes
the space group. the &ldquo;Absorption&rdquo; option
writes a file containing some calculations based on tables of X-ray
absorption coefficients.
</p>

<p>
The clear button is used to clear all data from all controls on the
<span class=program>ATOMS</span> tab.
</p>

<p>
The run button is pressed to convert the crystal data
into input data for <span class=program>FEFF</span>.  Pressing this displays 
<a href="../feff/feff.html">the next tab</a>.
</p>

<p>
The aggregate button is discussed in detail in 
<a href="../feff/aggregate.html">a later section</a>
