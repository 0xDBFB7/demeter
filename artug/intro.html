<h1>
  Introduction
</h1>

<p>

<span class=program>FEFF</span> and <span class=program>IFEFFIT</span> are amazing tools, but they can be
somewhat hard to use.  <span class=program>FEFF</span> requires the use of clunky text files
with confusing syntax
as its input.  <span class=program>IFEFFIT</span> has a wordy, finicky syntax.  Both benefit
by being wrapped up inside of something easier to use.  Hopefully,
<span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> is that something.

<h2>  The technology behind Artemis</h2>

<a name="perl">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h3>  perl</h3>

<p>

<span class=program>DEMETER</span> uses <a href="http://perl.org">perl</a>.  This is, I suppose, an unsexy
choice these days.  All the cool kids are, after all, using python or
ruby.  I like perl.  I can think in perl.  And I can code quickly and
fluently in perl.  What's  more, perl has <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>, the worlds largest
repository of language extensions.  CPAN means that I have far fewer
wheels to recreate (and probably get wrong).  Virtually any language
extension I need in pursuit of making <span class=program>DEMETER</span> awesome probably
already exists.
</p>

<a name="wxwidgetsandwxperl">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h3>  wxWidgets and wxPerl</h3>
<span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> uses 
<a href="http://wxwidgets.org/">wxWidgets</a>
and its perl wrapper 
<a href="http://wxperl.sourceforge.net/">wxPerl</a>
as its graphical toolkit.  This cross-platform tool
gives <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> a truly native look and feel because
it uses the platform's  native API rather than emulating the
GUI.  Using wx's rich set of graphical tools, <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>
strives to provide a powerful yet user-friendly environment in which
to perform EXAFS data analysis.

<hr class=hide />
<a name="moose">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</a>

<h3>  Moose</h3>

<p>

<span class=program>DEMETER</span> uses <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~flora/Moose/lib/Moose/Manual.pod">Moose</a>.  This is,
on the balance, a very good thing, indeed.  Moose brings many powerful
capabilities to the programming table.  When I was about halfway
through writing <span class=program>DEMETER</span>, I paused for a bit less than a month to
rewrite everything I had thus far created to use Moose.  This left me
with about 2/3 as many lines of code and a code base that was more
robust and more featureful.  Neat-o!
</p>

<p>
For the nerdly, Moose is an implementation of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Metaobject">meta-object protocol</a>.  This interesting
and powerful tool allows for the semantics of the object system to be
modified at either compile or run time.  The problem of adding
features and functionality to the object system is therefore pushed
downstream from the developers of the language to the users of the
language.  In good CPAN fashion, a healthy and robust ecosystem has
evolved around Moose producing a whole host of useful extensions.
</p>

<p>
Moose offers lots of great features, including an extremely powerful
attribute system, a type attribute system, method modifiers, an
ability to mix object and aspect orientation, and a wonderfully deep
set of automated tests.  I am confident that simply by using Moose, my
code is better code and, because Moose testing is so deep, I am
confident that any bugs in <span class=program>DEMETER</span> are my fault and not the
fault of the people whose work I depend on.
</p>

<p>
For all the wonderfulness of Moose, it does have one big wart that I
need to be up-front about.  Moose is slow at start-up.  Since 
<span class=program>DEMETER</span> is big and Moose starts slowly, any program using 
<span class=program>DEMETER</span> will take about 2 extra second to start.  For a
long-running program like a complicated fitting script or a GUI, an
additional couple of seconds at start-up is no big deal.  For
quick-n-dirty or one-off application, that may a bit annoying.  The
Moose folk claim to be working on start-up issues.  I am keeping my
fingers crossed.  Until then, I live with the slow start-up, confident
that the rest of <span class=program>DEMETER</span> is worth the wait.

<h3>  Templates, backends, and other tools</h3>

<p>

All of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>' interactions with <span class=program>FEFF</span>, <span class=program>IFEFFIT</span>, and
its plotting tools use <a href="https://metacpan.org/module/Text::Template">a templating
library</a>.  Along with a clean separation between function within the
<span class=program>DEMETER</span> code base and syntax of the various tools used by
<span class=program>DEMETER</span>, the use of templated interactions provides a clear
upgrade path for all parts of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.  
</p>


<dl>
  
<dt>
  Feff
</dt>
<dd>
Although <span class=program>DEMETER</span> ships with a freely redistributable version of
<span class=program>FEFF6</span>, it is possible to upgrade to use later versions of <span class=program>FEFF</span>
by providing an appropriate set of templates.  At this time, <span class=program>FEFF8</span>
is partially supported, with better support coming soon.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd>
<dt>
  Ifeffit and Larch
</dt>
<dd>
Matt Newville, the author of <span class=program>IFEFFIT</span>, is hard at work on
<span class=program>IFEFFIT</span>'s successor, called <span class=program>LARCH</span>.  The path to supporting
<span class=program>LARCH</span> will be relatively shallow, requiring only authorship of a
new set of templates.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd>
<dt>
  plotting
</dt>
<dd>
<span class=program>DEMETER</span> currently supports two plotting backends: PGPLOT, which is
the native plotting tool in <span class=program>IFEFFIT</span>, and <span class=program>GNUPLOT</span>.  New
plotting backends can be supported, again simply by creation of new
set of templates.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd>
</dl>

<p>

For numerically intensive parts of the code, <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> relies on
<a href="http://pdl.perl.org/">the Perl Data Language</a>,
a natively vector-oriented numerical language.
</p>

<p>
<span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> makes use a host of other tools from CPAN, the online perl
library, including tools for date and time manipulation; heap and tree
data structures; tools for formal graph theory; tools for manipulating
zip, INI, and yaml files; and many others.  These tools from CPAN are
extensively tested and highly reliable.

<a name="foldersandlogfiles">

<h2>  Folders and log files</h2>

<p>

On occasion, it is helpful to know something about how <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>
writes information to disk during its operations.
</p>


<dl>
  
<dt>
  working folder
</dt>
<dd>
Many of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>' chores involve writing temporary files.
Project files are unpacked in temporary folders.  <span class=program>GNUPLOT</span> writes temporary
files as part of its plot creation.  These files are stored in the 
&ldquo;stash folder&rdquo;.  On linux (and other
unixes) this is <span class=file>/.horae/stash/</span>.  On
Windows this is <span class=file>%APPDATA%\demeter\stash</span>.
  <br />
  <br />
</dd> 
<dt>
  log files
</dt>
<dd>
When <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> runs into problems, it attempts to write enough
information to the screen that the problem can be addressed.  This
screen information is what Bruce needs to troubleshoot bugs.  On a
linux (or other unix) machine, simply run <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> from the command
line and the informative screen messages will be written to the
screen.

On a Windows machine, it is uncommon to run the software from the
command line, so <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> has been instrumented to write a run-time
log file.  This log file is called 
<span class=file>dartemis.log</span> and can be found in the 
<span class=file>%APPDATA%\demeter</span> folder.  
  <br />
  <br />
</dd> 
</dl>

<p>

<span class=file>%APPDATA%</span>
is <span class=file>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppDataRoaming\</span>
on Windows 7.
</p>

<p>
It is <span class=file>C:\Documents&nbsp;and&nbsp;Settings\&lt;username&gt;\Application&nbsp;Data\</span>
on Windows XP and Vista.  
</p>

<p>
In either case, 
<span class=file>username</span>
is your log-in name.
