<h1>
  Understanding and denoting space groups
</h1>

<hr class=hide />
<a name="notationconventions">

<h2>  Notation conventions</h2>
</a>

<p>
The two most commonly used standards for the designation of three
dimensional space groups are the Hermann-Maguin and Schoenflies
conventions. <span class=program>ATOMS</span> recognizes both conventions.  Each of the
230 space groups as designated in each convention is listed later in
this chapter.
</p>

<p>
The Hermann-Maguin system uses four symbols to uniquely specify the
group properties of each of the 230 space groups. The first symbol is
a single letter 
<tt>P</tt>,
<tt>I</tt>,
<tt>R</tt>,
<tt>F</tt>,
<tt>A</tt>,
<tt>B</tt>, or
<tt>C</tt>
which refers to the Bravais lattice type. The remaining three letters
refer to the point group of the crystal.
</p>

<p>
Some modifications to the notation convention are made for use with a
keyboard.  Spaces must separate each of the four symbols. Subscripted
numbers are printed next to the number being modified
(e.g. 6<sub>3</sub> is printed as <tt>63</tt>).
A bar above a number is entered with a minus sign.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally there are variations in how space groups are
referenced. For example, the hausmannite structure of Mn3 O4 is placed
in space group <tt>I 41/A M D</tt> by the
conventions laid out in <em></em>.
In <em></em> v. 3, Wyckoff denotes
this space group as <tt>I 4/A M D</tt>.  This sort
of incongruity is unfortunate.  The list of Hermann-Maguin space group
designations as recognized by <span class=program>ATOMS</span> is shown below.  If you cannot
resolve the incongruity using this list, try using the Schoenflies
notation.
</p>

<p>
The Schoenflies conventions are also recognized by <span class=program>ATOMS</span>.  In the
literature there is less variation in the application of these
conventions.  The Schoenflies convention is, in fact, less precise
than the Hermann-Maguin in that the complete symmetry characteristics
of the crystal are not encoded in the space group
designation. Adaptations to the keyboard have been made here as well.
Subscripts are denoted with an underscore (<tt>_</tt>) and superscripts are denoted with a caret (^.  Spaces
are not allowed in the keyboard designation. A couple of examples:
<tt>d_4^8</tt>, and <tt>O_5</tt>. The underscore does not
need to precede to superscript.  <tt>C_2V^9</tt> can also be written
<tt>C_9^2V</tt>.  Each of the 230 space groups as designated by the
Schoenflies notation is listed below in the same order as the listing
of the Hermann-Maguin notation.  The two conventions are equally
supported in the code.  </p>


<hr class=hide />
<a name="uniquecrystallographicpositions">

<h2>  Unique Crystallographic Positions</h2>
</a>

<p>
The atoms list in <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> is a list of the
unique crystallographic sites in the unit cell.  A unique site is one
(and only one) of a group of equivalent positions.  The equivalent
positions are related to one another by the symmetry properties of the
crystal.  <span class=program>ATOMS</span> determines the symmetry properties of the
crystal from the name of the space group and applies those symmetry
operations to each unique site to generate all of the equivalent
positions.
</p>

<p>
If you include more than one of a group of equivalent positions in the
atom list, then a few odd things will happen.  A series of run-time
messages will issued telling you that atom positions were found that
were coincident in space.  This is because each of the equivalent
positions generated the same set of points in the unit cell.
<span class=program>ATOMS</span> removes these redundancies from the atom list. The atom list
and the potentials list written to <span class=file>feff.inp</span> will be correct and <span class=program>FEFF</span> can be run correctly
using this output.  However, the site tags and the indexing of the
atoms will certainly make no sense.  Also the density of the crystal
will be calculated incorrectly, thus the absorption calculation and
the self-absorption correction will be calculated incorrectly as
well. The McMaster correction is unaffected.
</p>

<a name="speciallyrecognizedlatticetypes">

<h2>  Specially Recognized Lattice Types</h2>
</a>

<p>
For some common crystal types it is convenient to have a shorthand way
of designating the space group. For instance, one might remember that
copper is an fcc crystal, but not that it is in space group <tt>F M 3 M</tt> (or <tt>O_H^5</tt>). In this
spirit, <span class=program>ATOMS</span> will recognize the following words for common
crystal types. These words may be used as the value of the keyword
space and <span class=program>ATOMS</span> will supply the correct space group. Note that
several of the common crystal types are in the same space groups. For
copper it will still be necessary to specify that an atom lies at
(0,0,0), but it isn't necessary to remember that the space group
is <tt>F M 3 M</tt>.
</p>

<h2>  Bravais Lattice Conventions</h2>
</a>

<p>
<span class=program>ATOMS</span> assumes certain conventions for each of the Bravais

and angles in each Bravais lattice.
</p>


<ul>
  
<li><p>

<a name="lowsymmetryspacegroups">

<h2>  Low Symmetry Space Groups</h2>
</a>

<p>
In three dimensional space there is an ambiguity in choice of right
handed coordinate systems. Given a set of mutually orthogonal axes,
there are six choices for how to label the positive <tt>x</tt>, <tt>y</tt>, and <tt>z</tt> directions. For some specific physical problem, the
crystallographer might choose a non-standard setting for a crystal.
The choice of standard setting is described in detail in <tt>The International Tables</tt>. The Hermann-Maguin symbol
describes the symmetries of the space group relative to this choice of
coordinate system.
</p>

<p>
The symbols for triclinic crystals and for crystals of high symmetry
are insensitive to choice of axes. Monoclinic and orthorhombic
notations reflect the choice of axes for those groups that possess a
unique axis. Tetragonal crystals may be rotated by 45 degrees about
the z axis to produce a unit cell of doubled volume and of a different
Bravais type. Alternative symbols for those space groups that have
them are listed in Appendix A.
</p>

<p>
<span class=program>ATOMS</span> recognizes those non-standard notations for these crystal
classes that are tabulated in <tt>The International
Tables</tt>.  <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> may use any of these
alternate notations so long as the specified cell dimensions and
atomic positions are consistent with the choice of notation. Any
notation not tabulated in chapter 6 of the 1969 edition of <tt>The International Tables</tt> will not be recognized by
<span class=program>ATOMS</span>.
</p>

<p>
This resolution of ambiguity in choice of coordinate system is one of
the main advantages of the Hermann-Maguin notation system over that of
Shoenflies. In a situation where a non-standard setting has been
chosen in the literature, use of the Schoenflies notation will, for
many space groups, result in unsatisfactory output from <span class=program>ATOMS</span>.  In
these situations, <span class=program>ATOMS</span> requires the use of the Hermann-Maguinn
notation to resolve the choice of axes.
</p>

<p>
Here is an example. In the literature, La<sub>2</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub> was given
in the non-standard <tt>b m a b</tt> setting rather
than the standard <tt>c m c a</tt>.  As you can see
from the axes and coordinates, these settings differ by a 90 degree
rotation about the <tt>A</tt> axis.  The coordination
geometry of the output atom list will be the same with either of these
input files, but the actual coordinates will reflect this 90 degree
rotation.

<h2>  Rhombohedral Space Groups</h2>
</a>

<p>
There are seven rhombohedral space groups. Crystals in any of these
space groups that may be represented as either monomolecular
rhombohedral cells or as trimolecular hexagonal cells. These two
representations are entirely equivalent. The rhombohedral space groups
are the ones beginning with the letter <tt>R</tt> in
the Hermann-Maguin notation. <span class=program>ATOMS</span> does not care which
representation you use, but a simple convention must be maintained. If
the rhombohedral representation is used then the keyword &alpha;
must be specified in <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> to designate
the angle between the rhombohedral axes and the keyword <tt>a</tt> must be specified to designate the length of the
rhombohedral axes. If the hexagonal representation is used, then
<tt>a</tt> and <tt>c</tt> must be
specified in <span class=file>atoms.inp</span>. &gamma; will be
set to 120 by the code. Atomic coordinates consistent with the choice
of axes must be used.
</p>



<hr class=hide />
<a name="multipleoriginsandtheshiftkeyword">

<h2>  Multiple Origins and the Shift Keyword</h2>
</a>

<p>
Some space groups in <em>The International Tables</em>
are listed with two possible origins. The difference is only in which
symmetry point is placed at (0,0,0). <span class=program>ATOMS</span> always wants the
orientation labeled &ldquo;origin-at-centre&rdquo;. This
orientation places (0,0,0) at a point of highest crystallographic
symmetry. Wyckoff and other authors have the unfortunate habit of not
choosing the &ldquo;origin-at-centre&rdquo; orientation
when there is a choice. Again Mn3 O4 is an example. Wyckoff uses the
&ldquo;origin at -4m2&rdquo; option, which places one Mn
atom at (0,0,0) and another at (0,1/4,5/8). <span class=program>ATOMS</span> wants the
&ldquo;origin-at-centre&rdquo; orientation which places
these atoms at (0,3/4,1/8) and (0,0,1/2).  Admittedly, this is an
arcane and frustrating limitation of the code, but it is not possible
to conclusively check if the &ldquo;origin-at-centre&rdquo; orientation has been chosen.
</p>

<p>
Twenty one of the space groups are listed with two origins in
<em>The International Tables</em>.  <span class=program>ATOMS</span> knows
which groups these are and by how much the two origins are offset, but
<strong>cannot</strong> know if you chose the correct one for
your crystal. If you use one of these groups, <span class=program>ATOMS</span> will print a
run-time message warning you of the potential problem and telling you
by how much to shift the atomic coordinates in <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> if the incorrect orientation was used. This warning
will also be printed at the top of the <span class=file>feff.inp</span> file. If you use the &ldquo;origin-at-center&rdquo; orientation, you may ignore this message.
</p>

<p>
If you use one of these space groups, it usually isn't hard to
know if you have used the incorrect orientation. Some common problems
include atoms in the atom list that are very close together (less than
1 &Aring;), unphysically large densities (see section 4.1), and
interatomic distances that do not agree with values published in the
crystallography literature. Because it is tedious to edit the atomic
coordinates in the input file every time this problem is encountered
and because forcing the user to do arithmetic invites trouble, there
is a useful keyword called <tt>shift</tt>.  For the
Mn3 O4 example discussed above, simply insert this line in <tt>atoms.inp</tt> if you have supplied coordinates referenced
to the incorrect origin:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
  shift = 0.0  0.25 -0.125
</pre>
This vector will be added to all of the coordinates in the atom list
after the input file is read.
</p>

<p>
Here is the input file for Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> using the shift keyword:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
title Mn3O4, hausmannite structure, using the shift keyword
a       5.75    c       9.42  core    Mn2

  O       0.0 0.25 0.375
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The above input file gives the same output as the following. Here the
shift keyword has been removed and the shift vector has been added to
all of the fractional coordinates. These two input files give
equivalent output.

<h2>  Denoting Space Groups</h2>
</a>

<p>
The following is my attempt to demystify the crazy symbolism used by
the Hermann-Maguin and Schoenflies conventions.  This is by no means
an adequate explanation of the rich and beautiful field of
crystallography.  For that, I recommend a real crystallography text.
</p>

<p>
An important part of the demystification process is to define some of
the important terms used to describe crystal symmetries. The words
<em>system</em>, <em>Bravais
lattice</em>, <em>crystal class</em>, and <em>space group</em> have well-defined meanings. The symbols used
in each of the notation conventions specifically relate the various
symmetries of crystals. In crystallography, a symmetry operation is
defined as a sequence of reflections, translations, and/or rotations
that map the crystal back onto itself in such a way that the crystal
after the mapping is indistinguishable from the crystal before the
mapping.
</p>


<hr class=hide />
<a name="aquickreviewofcrystallography">

<h3>  A Quick Review of Crystallography</h3>
</a>


<p>
To start, here are some definitions. These will be elaborated below.
</p>


<ul>
  
<li><p>
<strong>System</strong>: The undecorated shape of the unit cell.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Bravais Lattice</strong>: An undecorated lattice of equivalent points.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Crystal Class</strong>: The description of the symmetries about a point.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Space Group</strong>: The complete description of three dimensional
crystal symmetries.
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
There are seven systems of crystals. The system refers to the shape
of the undecorated unit cell. They are:
</p>


<ul>
  
<li><p>
<strong>Triclinic</strong>:
a &ne; b &ne; c, &alpha; &ne; &beta; &ne; &gamma; &ne; 90&deg;
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Monoclinic</strong>:
a &ne; b &ne; c, &alpha;=&gamma;=90&deg;, &beta; &ne; 90&deg;
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Orthorhombic</strong>:
a &ne; b &ne; c, &alpha;=&beta;=&gamma;=90&deg;
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Tetragonal</strong>:
a = b &ne; c, &alpha;=&beta;=&gamma;=90&deg;
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Hexagonal</strong>:
a = b &ne; c, &alpha;=&beta;=90&deg;, &gamma;=120&deg;
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Trigonal</strong>:
(rhombohedral axes):
a = b = c, &alpha;=&beta;=&gamma; < 120&deg; &ne; 90&deg;<br />
(hexagonal axes):
a = b &ne; c, &alpha;=&beta;=90&deg;, &gamma;=120&deg;
</p></li>
<li><p>
<strong>Cubic</strong>:
a = b = c, &alpha;=&beta;=&gamma;=90&deg;
</p></li>
</ul>


<p>
There are fourteen Bravais lattices. The Bravais lattices are
constructed from the simplest translational symmetries applied to the
seven crystal systems. A <tt>P</tt> lattice has
decoration only at the corners of the unit cell. An <tt>I</tt> lattice has decoration at the body center of the
cell as well as at the corners. An <tt>F</tt> lattice
has decoration at the face centers as well as at the corners. A
<tt>C</tt> lattice has decoration at the center of
the (001) face as well as at the corners. Likewise <tt>A</tt> and <tt>B</tt> lattices have decoration at
the centers of the (100) and (010) faces respectively.  <tt>R</tt> lattices are a special type in the trigonal system
which possess rhombohedral symmetry.
</p>

<p>
All seven crystal systems have <tt>P</tt> lattices,
but not all the classes have the other type of Bravais lattices. This
is because there is degeneracy when all the Bravais lattice types are
applied to all the crystal systems. For example, a face centered
tetragonal cell can be expressed as a body centered tetragonal cell by
rotating the two equivalent axes by 45&deg; and shortening them by a
factor of square root of 2. Considering such degeneracies reduces the
possible decorations of the seven systems to these 14 unique three
dimensional lattices:
</p>

<p>
<pre>
  Triclinic     P
  Monoclinic    P, C
  Orthorhombic  P, C, I, F
  Tetragonal    P, I
  Hexagonal     P
  Trigonal      P, R
  Cubic         P, I, F
</pre>
</p>

<p>
For historic reasons, hexagonal cells are sometimes called <tt>C</tt> lattices. <span class=program>ATOMS</span> will recognize hexagonal
<tt>P</tt> cells denoted in <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> by the letter <tt>C</tt>. Modern
literature usually uses the <tt>P</tt> designation.
</p>

<p>
The decorations placed on the Bravais lattices come in 32 flavors
called classes or point groups which represent the possible symmetries
within the decorations. Each type of symmetry is defined either by a
reflection plane, a rotation axis, or a rotary inversion axis. A
reflection plane can either be a simple mirror plane or a glide plane,
which defines the symmetry operation of reflecting through a mirror
followed by translating along a direction in the plane. A rotation
axis can either define a simple rotation or a screw rotation, which is
the symmetry operation of rotating about the axis followed by
translating along that axis. A rotary inversion axis defines the
symmetry operation of reflecting through a plane followed by rotating
about an axis in that plane.
</p>

<p>
These three symmetry types, reflection plane, rotation axis, and
rotary inversion axis, can be combined in 32 non-degenerate ways. (An
example degeneracy: the symmetry operation of combining a 180&deg;
rotary inversion with a mirror reflection is identical to the
operation of a simple 180&deg; rotation.) It would seem that the 32
classes could decorate the 14 Bravais lattices in 458 ways. In fact,
the number might be larger as there are numerous types of screw axes
and glide planes. Again, considering degeneracies reduces the total
number of combinations, leaving 230 unique decorations of the Bravais
lattices. These are called space groups. The 230 space groups are a
rigorously complete set of descriptions of crystal symmetries in three
dimensional space. That is, there may be new crystals but there are no
new space groups. Here I am only considering space-filling crystals
with translational periodicity. 3-D Penrose structures and
quasi-crystals are outside the realm of this appendix and of the code.

<h3>  Decoding the Hermann-Maguin Notation</h3>
</a>


<p>
The Hermann-Maguin notation uses a set of two to four symbols to
completely specify the symmetries of a space group. The first symbol
is always a single letter specifying the Bravais lattice. The next
three symbols specify the class of the space group. These three
symbols are some combination of the following characters:
<pre>
    1 2 3 4 5 6 A B C D M N / -
</pre>
</p>

<p>
These are sufficient to completely specify the various planar and
axial symmetries of the classes and sub-classes. The following is a
discussion of the most important rules of this convention. Some
details are neglected but sufficient information is provided to
appreciate the information contained in the notation.
</p>

<p>
The second symbol in the Hermann-Maguin notation, i.e. the one after
the Bravais lattice symbol, tells about symmetries involving the
primary axis of the cell and/or of the plane normal to the primary
axis. The primary axis is defined as follows:
</p>

<p>
<ul>
  
<li><p>
Triclinic: none
</p></li>
<li><p>
Monoclinic: the B axis
</p></li>
<li><p>
Orthorhombic: the C axis
</p></li>
<li><p>
Tetragonal: the C axis
</p></li>
<li><p>
Hexagonal: the C axis
</p></li>
<li><p>
Trigonal: the A axis
</p></li>
<li><p>
Cubic: the A axis
</p></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In cubic or rhombohedral lattices the axes are equivalent, thus the
primary axis is arbitrary. For orthorhombic lattices the third and
fourth symbols specify the symmetries of the a and b axes
respectively. In other lattices, the last two symbols encode the
remaining symmetries as described below.
</p>

<p>
A space filling crystal will always show a symmetry when rotated
through <tt>(360/n)</tt> degrees, where n is one of
<tt>1</tt>,  
<tt>2</tt>,
<tt>3</tt>,
<tt>4</tt>, or
<tt>6</tt>.
The second symbol often tells the rotational symmetry properties of
the primary axis. Notice that all trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal
groups have a <tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt>, or <tt>6</tt> respectively in their
designations. Many orthorhombic and monoclinic groups have a <tt>2</tt>, which is the highest degree of rotational symmetry
available to those lattices. Cubic groups may possess 2- or 4-fold
rotational symmetry about the cell axes, thus have <tt>2</tt> or <tt>4</tt> in the second symbol.
</p>

<p>
Many second symbols contain a second number. This is the subscripted
number when the Hermann-Maguin notation is typeset. This refers to the
type of screw symmetry associated with the axis. A screw symmetric
lattice is mapped onto itself by an anti-clockwise rotation through
<tt>m*(360/n)</tt> degrees and a translation of
<tt>1/n</tt> up the
primary axis. Here n is the degree of rotational symmetry, m is the type
of screw, and the definition of rotation and direction is
right-handed. Two types of screw symmetry that are different only in
handedness of rotation are called enantiomorphous. The enantiomorphous
pairs are <tt>31</tt> and <tt>32</tt>, <tt>41</tt> and <tt>43</tt>, <tt>61</tt>
and <tt>65</tt>, and <tt>62</tt> and
<tt>64</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Several of the second symbols are one or two numbers followed by a
slash and a letter, e.g. <tt>P 63/M M C</tt>. The
letter specifies the type of reflection plane that is normal to the
rotation axis.
</p>

<p>
There are several types of reflection planes. The simplest is a mirror
plane, denoted by the letter <tt>M</tt>. This says
the crystal is mapped onto itself by reflecting all atoms through a
mirror placed in an appropriate plane in the crystal. The letters
<tt>A</tt>, <tt>B</tt>, or <tt>C</tt> denote glide planes. These map the crystal onto
itself by reflecting through the plane then translating elements of
the crystal by half the length of the cell axis normal to the
reflection plane. A <tt>D</tt> glide plane is similar
but involves translations of a quarter of the cell axis
length. Finally, the letter <tt>N</tt> denotes a
diagonal glide plane, which is a reflection through a plane followed
by a translation in the same plane of half the length of both cell
axes in that plane.
</p>

<p>
The symbol <tt>-</tt> before a number indicates a
rotary inversion axis.  This maps the crystal back onto itself by
rotating through <tt>(360/n)</tt> degrees then reflecting through a plane
parallel to the rotation axis.
</p>

<p>
A final word about the Hermann-Maguin notation, all cubic space groups
have four three-fold rotational axes through the body diagonals. Thus
all cubic groups have the number 3 as the third symbol, e.g. <tt>F M 3 M</tt>.

<h3>  Decoding the Schoenflies Notation</h3>
</a>


<p>
The Schoenflies notation uses a set of three symbols to classify sets
of space groups by their dominant symmetry features. The letters
<tt>C</tt>, <tt>D</tt>, <tt>S</tt>, <tt>T</tt>, and <tt>O</tt> denote the character of the center of symmetry. The
symbol after the underscore (the subscript when typeset) indicates the
presence of symmetry planes and additional symmetry axes. The number
after the caret (the superscript when typeset) is simply an indexing
of all the distinct space groups that share major symmetry
properties. In the older literature, <tt>D</tt>
symmetry centers are occasionally referred to as <tt>V</tt>. <span class=program>ATOMS</span> will probably understand a space group referred to
by the letter <tt>V</tt>, but using the <tt>D</tt> notation is recommended.
</p>

<p>
The letter <tt>C</tt> indicates an rotation axis
where the crystal is mapped onto itself when rotated by <tt>(360/n)</tt> deg, where n is the number after the
underscore. An <tt>H</tt> after the underscore
indicates the presence of a plane of symmetry normal to the rotation
axis. A <tt>V</tt> after the underscore indicates one
or two planes of symmetry parallel to the rotation axis. The letter
<tt>S</tt> after the underscore indicates a normal
plane of symmetry in a crystal where the degree of rotational symmetry
is 1. The letter <tt>I</tt> after the underscore
indicates the presence of a point center of symmetry.
</p>

<p>
The letter <tt>S</tt> indicates a rotary inversion
axis. The degree of rotation is the number after the underscore.
</p>

<p>
The letter <tt>D</tt> denotes a primary rotation axis
with another rotation axis normal to it. The degree of rotation of
both axes is the number after the underscore. The letters <tt>H</tt> and <tt>V</tt> have the same
meanings as they did in groups beginning with the letter <tt>C</tt>. The letter <tt>D</tt> indicates
the presence of a diagonal symmetry plane.
</p>

<p>
Cubic groups are all specified by the letters <tt>T</tt> and <tt>O</tt>.  <tt>T</tt>
indicates tetrahedral symmetry, that is, the presence of the four
three-fold axes and three two-fold axes. <tt>O</tt>
indicates octahedral symmetry, i.e. four three-fold axes with three
four-fold axes. <tt>H</tt> and <tt>D</tt> after the underscore carry the same meaning as before.

<h4>  Non-Standard Settings</h4>
</a>

<p>
Here are the notations for the alternate settings of the monoclinic
and orthorhombic space groups. Also presented are the notations for
tetragonal space groups that have been rotated by 45 degrees resulting
in a unit cell of doubled volume and of a different Bravais type.
</p>

<p>
In an monoclinic or orthorhombic space group, the Hermann-Maguin
symbols are identical for the various settings if none of the three
axes possess special symmetry properties. In this case the three axes
are distinguished only by length and the symbol is the same for all
settings.
</p>

<p>
The column headings below indicate the orientations of the alternative
settings relative to the standard setting. For instance, <tt>cab</tt> is
a setting with axes and coordinates cyclically permuted from the
standard setting. This is equivalent to a rotation of 120 degrees
about an axis in a <111> direction relative to the Cartesian
axes. The setting <tt>a-cb</tt> is rotated by 90 degrees about the A
axis. Thus the <tt>B</tt> and <tt>C</tt> axes are swapped and the <tt>y</tt> and
<tt>z</tt> coordinates in the standard setting map
onto the <tt>z</tt> and
<tt>-y</tt> coordinates of the alternate setting. In <span class=program>ATOMS</span>, when an
alternative setting is specified in <span class=file>atoms.inp</span>, the axes and
coordinates are multiplied by the appropriate permutation matrix onto
the standard setting. The positions in the unit cell are expanded
according to the Hermann-Maguin symbol for the standard setting. The
contents of the unit cell are then permuted back to the specified
setting.
