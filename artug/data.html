<h1>
  The Data window
</h1>

<p>
After importing data from an <span class=program>ATHENA</span> project file, several things happen:
</p>


<ol>
  
<li><p>
A new Data window is created for interacting with that data set and
the various controls are set to values taken from the <span class=program>ATHENA</span>
project file or from <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>'   defaults.
</p></li>
<li><p>
A message is written to the status bar in the Main window.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The data are plotted in k-space.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The data are transferred to the plotting list in the Plot window.
</p></li>
<li><p>
An entry is placed in the Data list on the main window.
</p></li>
</ol> 

<p>
Here is the Plot window as it initially appears:
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 843px; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=datawindow>
<img src=../images/datawindow.png width=100%>
</a>
<p align=center>
The Artemis data window, immediately after data import.
</p>
</div>

<ol>
  
<li><p>
This button is used to transfer this data set into the plotting list
in the <a href="plot/index.html">Plot window</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
This is the <a href="extended/cv.html">characteristic value</a> of this data set.  Typically, this is
just incremented for each data set as it is imported.  The CV can be
used as a special parameter in math expressions. 
</p></li>
<li><p>
This text box shows where this data set came from.  Typically, this
shows the fully resolved file name for an <span class=program>ATHENA</span> project file,
followed by the index of the data from that project file.
</p></li>
<li><p>
These five buttons generate special plots using this data set.  Each
of the special plots types is explained below.  Like the Fit button
from the main window, these buttons are recolored after a fit
according to the value of the fit's 
<a href="fit/happiness.html">happiness parameter</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
This text box contains any title lines associated with the data.
</p></li>
<li><p>
These controls are used to set the functional form of the windows for
forward and backward Fourier transforms.  The R<sub>min</sub> and 
R<sub>max</sub> values are also used as the fitting range.  The menus for
selecting the windows functions are only displayed when the
<span class=pref>&diams;Artemis&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;window_function</span> is
set to &ldquo;user&rdquo;.
</p></li>
<li><p>
These check buttons are used to set the k-weight values used to
evaluate the fit.  Note that these are <em>check</em>
buttons and <em>radio</em> buttons not &ndash; more
than one can be selected at a time.  The default is that
all of 1, 2, and 3 checked, resulting in a multiple k-weight fit.
The default can be changed by editing the 
<span class=pref>&diams;Fit&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;k1</span>,
<span class=pref>&diams;Fit&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;k2</span>, and
<span class=pref>&diams;Fit&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;k3</span> parameters.
</p></li>
<li><p>
This area contains several other parameters related to this data set.
When the first check button is checked, this data will be included in
the fitting model.  Unchecking it is a way of removing a data set from
a multiple data set fit without actually disposing of the data.  The
second check button instructs <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> to automatically transfer
this data set to the 
<a href="plot/index.html">plotting list</a>
at the end of a fit.  The third
check button turns on background co-refinement.  The  &epsilon;
text box allows you to specify a measurement error fit this data set.
Finally, the last check button turns phase corrected plotting on and
off.  See <a href="path/plot.html#phasecorrectedplots">the discussion of
phase corrected plots</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
This status bar is used to display messages specifically related to
this data set.  These messages are logged in 
<a href="./monitor.html#thestatusbuffer">the status buffer</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The paths list will become populated as paths are associated with
this data set.  How that works will be explained in 
<a href="path/index.html">the next chapter</a>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
When no paths have yet been associated with a data set, this default
page is displayed.  The lines of blue text are sensitive to mouse
clicks and initiate the import of certain kinds of data.  All of those
import options will be explained elsewhere in this document.
</p></li>
</ol> 

<p>
After one or more paths have been associated with this data set, the
Data window looks something like this.  
</p>

<p>
<div class=figure style="max-width: 851px; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=datawindow_withpaths>
<img src=../images/datawindow_withpaths.png width=100%>
</a>
<p align=center>
The Artemis data window, with imported paths.
</p>
</div>
</p>

<p>
Note that the paths list is
populated with the paths assigned to these data and that the right
hand side of the Data window displays the details about a particular
path.  Clicking on an item in the paths list causes that path to be
displayed on the right.
</p>

<p>
Note that each path in the path list has a check button associated
with it.  These check buttons are involved in much of the
functionality described below.
</p>

<p>
Some vocabulary: The highlighted path is displayed on the right and is
said to be <em>selected</em>.  When a paths check
button is checked, it is said to be <em>marked</em>.
In this example, the first path is selected and no paths have yet been
marked. 
</p>

<h2>  Special plots</h2>

<p>
The five plot buttons on the Data window make special plots of that
data set along with its fit (if a fit has been run).  Each of these is
an elaborate, multi-component plot that cannot be made using the tools
on the Plot window.  The examples shown here are for a fit to gold
metal out to the fourth coordination shell.

over the k-weight of 1 spectrum to indicate the range over which the
fit was evaluated (assuming the fit space is R, as is the default).
The radio button in the 
<a href="plot/index.html">Plot window</a>

<a class=floatright href="../images/data-marksmenu.png"  title=Marks menu target=_blank><img border=0 src="../images/data-marksmenu.png"  title="Marks menu"  alt="data-marksmenu.png"></a>
Much of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>' functionality revolves around groups of
marked paths.  This menu contains a number of shortcuts for marking
paths.  Note that each of these has a keyboard shortcut
given on the right side of the menu.  Learning the shortcuts for
marking functions that you use frequently is key to the effective use
of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.
</p>

<p>
Marking via these functions is cumulative.  That is, most of them only
add to the set of marked paths.   Choosing to mark, say, all single
scattering paths will not unmark any marked multiple scattering paths.
</p>

<p>
Several of these functions will post a dialog for receiving input.
Marking by regular expression (regex) will prompt for a perl-style
regular expression to match against the labels in the path list.  The
pattern you provide will be used only if it can be successfully parsed
as a valid perl regular expression.
</p>

<p>
Marking either greater than or less than an A value will prompt for
a cutoff in path ranking.
</p>

<p>
Marking either greater than or less than an R value will prompt for
that R value.
</p>

<p>
Marking before or after the current path will mark those above or
below the displayed path in the path list.  Included and excluded
refers to whether a path is selected as being included in a fit.</p>
<hr class=hide />
<p class=caution>
<img class=tinyfloatleft border=0 src="../images/alert.png" alt="Caution!">
When using regular expression marking, you have access to perl's
entire regular expression functionality.  If you know what a
&ldquo;(?{ code })&rdquo; extended expression is and you
use it foolishly, you only have yourself to blame.

Every item in this menu operates either on the set of included paths
or the set of marked paths.  Again, keyboard shortcuts are given in
the menu.
</p>

<p>
The first two options will make
<a href="plot/vpaths.html">a VPath</a>
out of either all the paths for this data set or the marked paths.
The VPath will be placed in the plotting list in the
<a href="plot/index.html">Plot window</a>
and a plot will be made in R.
The option to make the sum of all paths is particularly useful for
comparing the fittingmodel to the data without actually running the fit.
</p>

<p>
The next two options will transfer paths to the plotting list, then
make a plot in R.
</p>

<p>
The next two options will cause the set of marked paths to be included
in or excluded from the fit.  The next item computes the value of
<a href="extended/bvs.html">a bond valence sum</a>
using the set of marked paths.  You will be prompted for some
information about the absorber and scatterer.
</p>

<p>
The next item causes all marked paths to be discarded from your
fitting project and removed from the path list.
</p>

<p>
The final two items are about controlling what gets transferred into the
plotting list after a fit.  The next to last item causes all marked
paths to be transferred.  The last item removes all paths from the list
of things transferred
