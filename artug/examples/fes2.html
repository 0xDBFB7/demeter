<h2>  Import data</h2>

<p>
After starting <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>, click on the &ldquo;Add&rdquo; button at the top of the &ldquo;Data sets&rdquo; list in the Main window.  This will open a file
selection dialog.  Click to find the <span class=program>ATHENA</span> project file
containing the data you want to analyze.  Opening that project file
displays the project selection dialog.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../images/fes2-importdata.png" target=_blank><img width=75% src="../../images/fes2-importdata.png" title="

" alt="

"></a>
</p>

<p>
The project file used here has several iron standards.  Select
FeS<sub>2</sub> from the list.  That data set gets plotted when selected.
</p>

<p>
Now click the &ldquo;Import&rdquo; button.  That data
set gets imported into <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.  An entry for the FeS<sub>2</sub> is
created in the Data list, a window for interacting with the FeS<sub>2</sub>
data is created, and the FeS<sub>2</sub> data are plotted as &chi;(k).
</p>

<p>
The next step is to prepare for the <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation using the
known FeS<sub>2</sub> crystal structure.  Clicking on the line in the Data
window that says &ldquo;Import crystal data or a
Feff calculation&rdquo; will post a file selection ddialog.  Click to find
the <span class=file>atoms.inp</span> file containing the FeS<sub>2</sub>
crystal structure.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../images/fes2-importatoms.png" target=_blank><img width=75% src="../../images/fes2-importatoms.png" title="

" alt="

"></a>
</p>

<p>
With the FeS<sub>2</sub> crystal data imported, run <span class=program>ATOMS</span> by clicking the 
&ldquo;Run Atoms&rdquo; button on the Atoms tab of the
<span class=program>FEFF</span> windows.  That will display the Feff tab containing the
<span class=program>FEFF</span> input data.  Click the &ldquo;Run Feff&rdquo;
button to compute the scattering potentials and to run the pathfinder.
</p>

<p>
Once the <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation is finished, the path intepretation list
is shown in the Paths tab.  This is the list of scattering paths,
sorted by increasing path length.  Select the first 11 paths by
clicking on the path 0000, then shift-clicking on path 0010.  These
group of selected paths will be highlighted.  Click on one of the
highlighted paths and, without letting go of the mouse button, drag
the paths over to the Data winodw.  Drop the paths on the empty Path
list.
</p>

<p>

" alt="

"></a>
</p>

<p>
Dropping the paths on the Path list will associate those paths with
that data set.  That is, that group of paths is now available to be
used in the fitting model for understanding the FeS<sub>2</sub> data.
</p>

<p>
Each path will get its own Path page.  The Path page for a path is
displayed when that path is clicked upon in the Path list.  Shown
below is the FeS<sub>2</sub> data with its 11 paths.  The first path in the
list, the one representing the contribution to the EXAFS from the S
single scattering path at 2.257 &Aring;, is currently displayed.

<h2>  Examine the scattering paths</h2>


<p>
The first chore is to understand how the various paths from the
<span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation relate to the data.  To this end, we need to
populate the Plotting list with data and paths and make some plots.
</p>

<p>
First let's examine how the single scattering paths relate to
the data.  Mark each of the first four single scattring paths
&ndash; the ones labeled 
&ldquo;S.1&rdquo;,
&ldquo;S.2&rdquo;,
&ldquo;S.3&rdquo;, and
&ldquo;Fe.1&rdquo; &ndash; by clicking on their check
buttons.  Transfer those four paths to the Plotting list by selecting 
&ldquo;Transfer marked&rdquo; from the Actions menu.
</p>

<p>
With the Plotting list poluated as shown below, click on the 
&ldquo;R&rdquo; plot button in the Plot window to make
the plot shown.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../images/fes2-sspaths.png" target=_blank><img width=75% src="../../images/fes2-sspaths.png" title="
FeS2 data plotted with the first four single scattering paths
" alt="
FeS2 data plotted with the first four single scattering paths
"></a>
</p>

<p>
The first interesting thing to note is that the first peak in the data
seems to be entirely explained by the path from the S atom at 2.257
&Aring;.  None of the other single scattering paths contribute
significantly to the region of R-space.
</p>

<p>
The second interesting thing to note is that the next three single
scattering paths are not so well separated from one another.  While it
may be tempting to point at the peaks at 2.93 &Aring; and 3.45 &Aring;
and assert that they are due to the second shell S and the fourth
shell Fe, it is already clear that the situation is more
complicated.  Those three single scattering paths overlap one
another.  Each contriobutes at least some spectral weight to both of
the peaks at 2.93 &Aring; and 3.45 &Aring;.
</p>

<p>
The first peak shold be reather simple to interpret, but higher shells
are some kind of superposition of many paths.
</p>

<p>
What about the multiple scattering paths?
</p>

<p>
To examine those, first clear the Plotting list by clicking the 
&ldquo;Clear&rdquo; button at the bottom of the Plot
window.  Transfer the FeS<sub>2</sub> data back to the Plotting list by
clicking its transfer button, <a href="../../images/plot-icon.png" target=_blank><img class=flexy src="../../images/plot-icon.png" title="transfer
button" alt="transfer
button"></a>.  Mark the first three multiple scattering paths by
clicking their mark buttons.  Select 
&ldquo;Transfer marked&rdquo; from the Actions menu.
</p>

<p>
With the Plotting list newly populated, make a new plot of |&chi;(R)|.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../images/fes2-mspaths1.png" target=_blank><img width=75% src="../../images/fes2-mspaths1.png" title="
FeS2 data plotted with the first three multiple scattering paths
" alt="
FeS2 data plotted with the first three multiple scattering paths
"></a>
</p>

<p>
The two paths labeled &ldquo;S.1 S.1&rdquo;, which
represent two different ways for the photoelectron to scatter from a S
atom in the first coordination shell then scatter from another S atom
in the first coordination shell, contribute rather little spectra
weight.  Given their small size, it seems possible that we may be able
to ignore those paths when we analyze our FeS<sub>2</sub> data.
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;S.1 S.2&rdquo; path, which first scatters
from a S in the first coordination shell then from a S in the second
coordination shell, contributes significantly to the peak at 2.93
&Aring;.  It seems unlikely that we will be able to ignore that path.
</p>

<p>
To examine the next three multiple scattering paths, clear the
Plotting l ist, mark those paths, and repopulate the Plotting lilst.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../images/fes2-mspaths2.png" target=_blank><img width=75% src="../../images/fes2-mspaths2.png" title="
FeS2 data plotted with the next three multiple scattering paths
" alt="
FeS2 data plotted with the next three multiple scattering paths
"></a>
</p>

<p>
The &ldquo;S.1 Fe.1&rdquo; path, which scatters from a S
atom in the first coordination shell then scatters from an Fe atom in
the fourth coordination shell, is quite substantial.  It will
certainly need to be considered in our fit.  The other two paths are
tiny.
</p>

<a name="fittothefirstcoordinationshell">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>  Fit to the first coordination shell</h2>

<p>
We begin by doing an analysis of the first shell.  As we saw above,
we only need the first path in the path list.  To prepare for the fit,
we do the following:
<ol>
  
<li><p>
Exclude all but the first path from the fit.  With the first path
selected in the path list and displayed, select 
&ldquo;Mark after current&rdquo; from the Marks menu.
This will mark all paths except for the first one.  Then select 
&ldquo;Exclude marked&rdquo; from the Actions menu.
This will exclude those paths from the fit.  That is indicated by the
triple parentheses in the path list.  
</p></li>
<li><p>
Set the values of R<sub>min</sub> and R<sub>max</sub> to cover just the first peak.
</p></li>
<li><p>
For this
simple first shell fit, we set up a simple, four-parameter model.  The
parameters <tt>amp</tt>,
<tt>enot</tt>,
<tt>delr</tt>, and 
<tt>ss</tt> are defined in the GDS window and given
sensible initial guess values.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The path parameters for the first shell path are set.  S&sup2;&#8320; is set
to <tt>amp</tt>, E&#8320; is set
to <tt>enot</tt>, &Delta;R is set
to <tt>delr</tt>, and &sigma;&sup2; is set
to <tt>ss</tt>.
</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Note that the current settings for k- and R-range result in a bit more
than 7 independent points, as computed from the Nyquist criterion.
With only 4 guess parameters, this should be a reasonable fitting model.
</p>

" alt="

"></a>
</p>

<p>
Now hit the &ldquo;Fit&rdquo; button.  Upon completion
of the fit, the following things happen:
<ol>
  
<li><p>
An Rmr plot is made of the data and the fit.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The log Window is displayed with the results of the fit
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Fit and plot buttons are recolored according to the evaluation of
the happiness parameter.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The Plotting list is cleared and repopulated with the data.
</p></li>
<li><p>
The fit is entered into the History window (which is not in the
screenshot below).
</p></li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../images/fes2-firstshellfit.png" target=_blank><img width=75% src="../../images/fes2-firstshellfit.png" title="
Results of the first shell fit
" alt="
Results of the first shell fit
"></a>
</p>

<p>
This is not a bad result.  The value of <tt>enot</tt> is small, indicatng that a reasonable value of E&#8320; was
chosen back in <span class=program>ATHENA</span>.  <tt>delr</tt> is small
and consistent with 0, as we should expect for a known crystal.  
<tt>ss</tt> is a reasonable value with a reasonable
error bar.  The only confusing parameter is <tt>amp</tt>, which is a bit smaller than we might expect for a S&sup2;&#8320;
value.  
</p>

<p>
The correlations between parameters are of a size that we expect.  The
R-factor evaluates to about 2% misfit.  &chi;&sup2<sub>&nu;</sub> is really huge, but
that likely means that  &epsilon; was not evaluated correctly.  All
in all, this is a reasonable fit.
