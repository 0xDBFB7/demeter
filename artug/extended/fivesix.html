<h2>  Examples of situations requiring
consideration of higher order paths</h2>


<p>

Normally, the 
<a href="../feff/paths.html">pathfinder</a>
in <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>'s implementation of <span class=program>FEFF</span> only considers up to
triple scattering (4-legged) paths.  This is for two reasons.  First,
<span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>'s pathfinder is a bit slow.  Second, it is rather
uncommon to need higher order paths in an EXAFS analysis.  Here are a
few examples.
</p>

<p>
Paradibromobenzene is a benzene molecule &ndash; a ring of 6 carbon
atoms &ndash; with two of the hydrogen ligands replaced by bromine.
The bromine atoms are in the para (1-4) arrangement, i.e. on opposite
corners of the benzene ring.
</p>

<p>
Being the only heavy scatterer in a rigid structure, the second
bromine atom is quite evident in the EXAFS, giving rise to the large
peak just above 6 &Aring; in the &chi;(R) data shown below.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 100%; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=fivesix-paradibromobenzene>&nbsp;</a><br><a href=../../images/fivesix-paradibromobenzene.png><img src="../../images/fivesix-paradibromobenzene.png" width=193></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=../../images/fivesix-br-chir.png><img src="../../images/fivesix-br-chir.png" alt="foo" width=49%></a>
<br></a>
<p>
The paradibromobenzene molecule and its &chi;(R) data.
</p>
</div>

<p>

That big peak resulting from the second bromine atom includes not just
the single scattering contribution, but a number of collinear multiple
scattering paths.  This includes the 5-legged paths that scatter from
both carbon atoms on the way to (or from) the bromine atoms, and the
6-legged path that includes forward scattering from both carbon atoms
in both directions.
</p>

<p>
5- and 6-legged paths are, in general, only important in EXAFS for
structures that are both rigid and have 4 collinear atoms.  This is
pretty high bar, which is why examples are few and far between.  That
said, here are a couple more examples.
</p>


<p>
<a class=floatleft href="../../images/fivesix-prussian-blue.png" target=_blank><img border=0 src="../../images/fivesix-prussian-blue.png"   alt="fivesix-prussian-blue.png"></a>
Prussian blue, ferric ferrocyanate, represents a class of
framework-structured materials that have metal atoms at corner
positions in the unit cell.  These metal atoms are bridged by cyanide
molecules.  This is much like a rocksalt structure, but with the
cation replaced by a cyanide molecule oriented in the direction of the
bond.
</p>

<p>
The metal anions are separated by about 5.1 &Aring;, thus are at a
distance that can easily be resolved and analyzed with good EXAFS
data.  To interpret that part of the EXAFS signal, however, it is
necessary to consider all the multiple scattering paths involving the
C, N, and Fe atoms.  This includes significant, collinear 5- and
6-legged paths.
</p>

<p>
The final example is good ol' copper metal, which is often
analyzed out to about 5 &Aring;, a distance which includes 5
coordination shells and a number of double and triple scattering
paths.  To analyze farther in R, one eventual gets to the single
scattering path which includes the face center atom in the diagonally
adjacent cell.  In the figure below, the absorber is represented by
the pink atom.  The distant neighbor is the farthest lavender-colored
atom.  To analyze the single scattering contribution from that
distance would require consideration of all the multiple scattering
among the pink and lavender atoms, which are collinear along that unit
cell diagonal.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 100%; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=fivesix-cu7A>&nbsp;</a><br><a href=../../images/fivesix-cu7A.png><img src="../../images/fivesix-cu7A.png" width=259></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=../../images/fivesix-chir.png><img src="../../images/fivesix-chir.png" alt="foo" width=49%></a>
<br></a>
<p>
4 unit cells of FCC copper with the collinear atoms contributing at
about 7 &Aring; highlighted in lavender.  On the right is &chi;(R) data
for copper metal.  The signal from the various SS and MS involving the
lavender atoms paths contributes to the the peaks around 7 &Aring;.

<h2>  5 and 6 legged paths in Artemis</h2>

<p class=caution>
<img class=tinyfloatleft border=0 src="../../images/alert.png" alt="Caution!">
Enabling the calculation of 5- and 6-legged paths significantly slows
down the pathfinder calculation in <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.  If you are unsure
whether you need 5- and 6-legged paths, you almost certainly
<strong>do not</strong> want to do so!
</p>

<p>

The default behavior in <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> is to compute up to 4-legged
paths.  For any <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation, this can be extended to include
5- and 6-legged paths by selecting the 
&ldquo;6&rdquo; button, as indicated in the screenshot
below.  Note that this sets the order of scattering paths only for the
current <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculation.  The default for all subsequent <span class=program>FEFF</span>
calculations will again be 4-legged paths.
The <a href="../feff/aggregate.html">aggregate calculation</a>
is always made with up to 4-legged paths.
</p>

" alt="

"></a>


<p>

Besides being slow, the other consequence of setting the upper order
of multiple scattering to 6 is that the 
<a href="../feff/paths.html">path list</a>
will be much longer and possibly more confusing.  Really, truly!
Don't use this feature of <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> unless you have a very
good reason to do so.
</p>

<p>
Some <a href="../prefs.html">configuration parameters</a> that relate to choice of the order of multiple
scattering:
<ol>
  
<li><p>
<span class=pref>&diams;Pathfinder&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;suppress_5_6_not_straight</span>: When true, only consider 5- and
6-legged paths that have scattering angles within 
<span class=pref>&diams;Pathfinder&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;fs_angle</span> (typically 20 degrees) of 0 or 180 degrees.  That
is, suppress all paths with angles far from forward and backward scattering.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<span class=pref>&diams;Atoms&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;suppress_nleg_warning</span>: When
true, this will suppress the dialog box posted by <span class=program>ATOMS</span> when you
select the &ldquo;6&rdquo; button
warning you against considering 5- and 6-legged paths.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<span class=pref>&diams;Pathfinder&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;eta_suppress</span>: If
you need to consider nearly collinear paths in a structure with
buckling of atomic planes, you may need to set this parameter to
false.  When true, it suppresses any path with a non-zero Eulerian
&eta; angle.  In most cases, this is a good heuristic for removing
irrelevant paths from the path list, however for orders of scattering
above 4 and nearly collinear paths, this filter might remove desirable
paths.  Use this with caution as it will greatly expand the size of
the path list.
</p></li>
</ol>
