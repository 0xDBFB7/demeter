<h1>
  Fitting with empirical standards
</h1>

<p>
Let me just say up front that <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> is intended as a front-end
to <span class=program>FEFF</span> for the problem of EXAFS analysis.  In almost all cases,
<span class=program>FEFF</span> is the right tool for that job and there are extremely few
cases where the use of empirical standards is preferable to using
<span class=program>FEFF</span>.  As discussed elsewhere in this manual, there are a
situations where the application of <span class=program>FEFF</span> to a particular problem
may not be obvious.  Any situation for which the choice of a starting
configuration of atomic coordinates, as needed for <span class=program>FEFF</span>'s
input data, is not obvious might fall into that category.  In one of
those situations, you might be tempted to puruse empirical standards.
You would, however, usually be better served by adopting one of the
strategies that have been developed for applying <span class=program>FEFF</span> calculations
to unknown structures.
</p>

<p>
That said, there are a small handful of situations where the use of
empirical standards is justified.  In fact, I can think of two.  The
situation where an absorber and a scatterer are bound by a hydrogen
atom &ndash; i.e. there is a hydrogen atom in the space between the
absorber and scatterer from which the photoelectron might scatter
&ndash; is poorly handled by <span class=program>FEFF</span>.  In that case, finding a
suitable empirical standard will likely be an improvement over the
systematic error introduced by <span class=program>FEFF</span>'s poor handlng of the
hydrogen.  The second example would be a heterogeneous sample
&ndash; like a soil &ndash; which contains a component which
varies little from sample to sample.  In that case, using an emirical
standard to represent the unchanging component and using <span class=program>FEFF</span> to
model the behavior of the component(s) which do change across the
ensemble of measurements might be a fruitful strategy.
</p>

<p>
To this end, <span class=program>DEMETER</span> offers a mechanism for generating an
empirical standard from measured data.  This is saved in a form that
can be used by <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> as if it were a normal path imported into
the fit in the normal way.
</p>

<p>
My example will use the copper foil data at 10 K and 150 K, which can
be found at <a href="https://github.com/bruceravel/XAS-Education/tree/master/Examples">at my Github site</a>.  In order to demonstrate the gneration and use of an empirical
standard, I will use the uncomplicated example of using the low
temperature data as the standard for the analysis of the higher
temperature data.  Of course, a real-world scenario will be much more
complicated that this example, but it should demonstrate the mechanics
of making and using the empirical standard.

<h2>  Preparing the empirical standard</h2>
</a>


<p>
It starts by processing the data properly.  First, import the two data
sets into <span class=program>ATHENA</span>.  Take care that the data are aligned and have
the same values for E&#8320;.  Choose a k-range over which both data
sets are of good quality.  I have chosen a range of 3&Aring;&#8315;&sup1; to 12
&Aring;&#8315;&sup1;.  Then choose an R-range to enclose and isolate the first
peak, which corresponds to the first coordination shell.  Here, I
chose 1.8 &Aring; to 2.8 &Aring;.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 772px; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=emp_athena>
<img src=../../images/emp_athena.png width=100%>
</a>
<p align=center>
The Cu foil data at two temperatures have been imported into
<span class=program>ATHENA</span>, aligned, and processed.
</p>
</div>

<div class=figure style="max-width: 100%; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=emp_rplot>&nbsp;</a><br><a href=../../images/emp_rplot.png><img src="../../images/emp_rplot.png" width=49%></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=../../images/emp_qplot.png><img src="../../images/emp_qplot.png" alt="foo" width=49%></a>
<br></a>
<p>
Here are the Cu foil data at the two temperatures plotted in R-space
(left) and back-transform k-space (right).
</p>
</div>

<p>
Select the data set from which you wish to make an empirical standard,
in this case the data measured at 10 K.  In the File menu is a
&ldquo;Export&rdquo;.  One of the options is to export
an empirical standard.
</p>

<p align=center>
Exporting the processed data as an empirical standard.
</p>
</div>

<p>
This will prompt you for a file name using the standard file selection
dialog.  The default file is the name of the data group with
<span class=file>.es</span> as the extension.
It will then prompt you for the species of the scattering
element using a periodic table dialog.  <span class=program>ATHENA</span> has no way of
knowing the scatterer species, so 
you have to provide this information.  In this case, you would click
on Cu since this is a copper foil.

<h2>  Using the empirical standard</h2>
</a>


<p>
Now fire up <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> and import the 150 K data from the <span class=program>ATHENA</span>
project file you saved before closing <span class=program>ATHENA</span>.  (You 
<strong>did</strong> save your work, didn't you?!)
The k- and R-ranges will be imported as they were set in <span class=program>ATHENA</span>.
To begin the analysis using the empirical standard, click on the hot
text indicated in the figure below.  You can also import this sort of
standard from the 
&ldquo;Data->Other fitting standards...&rdquo; menu.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 843px; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=emp_importdata>
<img src=../../images/emp_importdata.png width=100%>
</a>
<p align=center>
The 150 K data have been imported into <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span> and we are ready to
import the prepared empirical standard.
</p>
</div>

<p>
Once the empirical standard is imported, it will be displayed just
like a normal path.  You can tell it is an empirical standard because its
label contains the token &ldquo;[Emp.]&rdquo;.
</p>

<p>
Here I have set up a 4-parameter fit typical for a first shell analysis,
except that I have set the E&#8320; parameter to 0.  The amplitude, &sigma;&sup2;, and
&Delta;R are guess parameters.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 843px; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=emp_importes>
<img src=../../images/emp_importes.png width=100%>
</a>
<p align=center>
The 150 K data and the empirical standard have been imported into <span class=program>ARTEMIS</span>.
</p>
</div>

<p>
We are now ready to hit the Fit button.  Shown below are the results
of the fit with the fitting space chosen first as R, then as q.
</p>


<div class=figure style="max-width: 100%; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=emp_fitr>&nbsp;</a><br><a href=../../images/emp_fitr.png><img src="../../images/emp_fitr.png" width=49%></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=../../images/emp_gdsr.png><img src="../../images/emp_gdsr.png" alt="foo" width=49%></a>
<br></a>
<p>
The results of the fit with the fitting space selected as R and the
plot displayed in R.
</p>
</div>

<div class=figure style="max-width: 100%; min-width: 7em;">
<a name=emp_fitq>&nbsp;</a><br><a href=../../images/emp_fitq.png><img src="../../images/emp_fitq.png" width=49%></a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=../../images/emp_gdsq.png><img src="../../images/emp_gdsq.png" alt="foo" width=49%></a>
<br></a>
<p>
The results of the fit with the fitting space selected as q and the
plot displayed in q.
</p>
</div>

<p>
The results fitting in R or q are pretty similar, which is reassuring.
</p>

<p>
The value for the amplitude is consistent with and close to 1, which
is should be since the copper metal is 12-fold coordinate at both
temperatures.
</p>

<p>
The value for the change in &sigma;&sup2; is 0.0017&plusmn;3, which seems
reasonable for this change in temperature.
</p>

<p>
The value for &Delta;R fitted in q space is 0.001&plusmn;1.  Fitted in R
space, the uncertainty is 0.002.  That's kind of interesting.
In either case, the uncertainty in R is smaller than for a Feff-based
fit for a number of reasons.  Probably the most significant is that
both standard and data are of excellent quality.  Were the data the
sort of marginal data that comes from most research problems on
difficult materials, the effects of statistical and systematic noise
would be much more dramatic.  Also relevant to the small uncertainty
is that this fitting problem has been contrived (by virtue of careful
alignment and choice of E&#8320; back in Athena) to remove the fitted
change in E&#8320; from the problem.  By removing the parameter most
correlated with &Delta;R, we significantly reduces the uncertainty in
&Delta;R.
</p>

<p>
I would not interpret all of this to mean that use of empirical
standards is superior to the use of Feff.  In the specific case where
the first coordination shell is of known contents and can be well
isolated from higher shells and where you are confident that your
unknown is identical to your standard except for small changes in N,
R, or &sigma;&sup2;, then empirical standards are a useful tool for your
EXAFS toolbox.</p>
