* getting started

installed perl 5.18.1 via perlbrew

~perl Build.pl~ immediately fails for missing File::Copy::Recursive,
which is used in DemeterBuilder.pm

Clarified use of F::C::R in build scripts.  It is now identified as a
build requirement.  It'll get installed at ~./Build installdeps~ time
so that it can be used at ~./Build~ time.

* Build installdeps

this proceeds.

wait a while....

XMLRPC::Lite fails to install.  forcing an install seems to work.
Do one of these:

  : cpanp i --force XMLRPC::Lite

or

  : ~> cpan
  : cpan> force install XMLRPC::Lite

or

  : cpanm -f XMLRPC::Lite

* when switching perl versions with perlbrew

 :  Build touch_wrapper

then

 :  cp /home/bruce/git/demeter/blib/arch/auto/Ifeffit/Ifeffit.so /home/bruce/perl/auto/Ifeffit/Ifeffit.so
