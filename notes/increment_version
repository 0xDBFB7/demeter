First:

  perl-reversion -bump -current 0.9.12

with "0.9.12" replaced with current version number

The perl-reversion script does not preserve execution bit, so

  cd bin
  chmod +x d* intrp redfit standards

then, perl-reversion misses examples in

 - bin/bugs.pod
 - bin/contribute.pod
 - bin/help.pod
 - bin/installation.pod
 - Build.PL

Finally, git push and tag.
