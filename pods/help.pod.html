<h1 id="NAME">NAME <a href="#TOP" class="toplink"><img alt="^" src="up.gif" /></a></h1>

<p>Seeking help about XAS or about the software</p>

<h1 id="VERSION">VERSION <a href="#TOP" class="toplink"><img alt="^" src="up.gif" /></a></h1>

<p>This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.9.11.</p>

<h1 id="OVERVIEW">OVERVIEW <a href="#TOP" class="toplink"><img alt="^" src="up.gif" /></a></h1>

<h2 id="Asking_questions_soliciting_help">Asking questions, soliciting help</h2>

<p>An excellent resource exists for anyone stumbling over the details of
XAFS experimentation or analysis -- the  <a href="http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ifeffit">Ifeffit mailing list</a>.
This low-noise, high-quality mailing list is populated by many of the
world's expert practitioners of XAS and it handles dozens of questions
every month.  It should be the first place you go when you have a
question about the software or about any other topic in XAS.</p>

<p>Demeter's author, Bruce, reads the mailing list and frequently
responds to questions.  You should send questions to the mailing list
and <strong>not</strong> to Bruce directly.  Bruce's typical response to an
unsolicited email about the software is a polite request to ask the
same question on the mailing list.</p>

<p>Using the mailing list is in your best interest.  The list gives you
access to a large number of experts and to the entire Ifeffit
community. When you send you question directly to me, you may find me
on travel, in the middle of an experiment, or simply unwilling to read
and write email. When you send mail to the list, you are much more
likely to get a useful answer from someone -- and that someone is
often me. In fact, you may spark a discussion in which your question
will be hashed out in much more detail than you would see in a
response from a single person.</p>

<p>Don't believe me? <a href="http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2011-September/010201.html">Here is a nice example</a>
of a question asked which prompted answers from several different
people.  Follow the links that say &quot;next message&quot; to read the various
answers to the question.  After an interesting and useful discussion,
the person with the original question <a href="http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2011-September/010215.html">had this to say</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/ifeffit@millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/">Here is a searchable archive</a>
of the Ifeffit mailing list.  You may find that someone else has
already asked your question.</p>

<h2 id="How_to_ask_for_help">How to ask for help</h2>

<p>If you are asking for help, I encourage you to ask specific questions
rather than vague ones. For example, </p>

<pre>  I don't understand multiple k-weight fitting. What does it mean to
  use more than one k-weight in a fit and why should I want to do so?

</pre><p>is a <strong>good</strong> question and is likely to get a detailed answer. On the
other hand,</p>

<pre>  I have lots of data from the synchrotron on TiO2 doped with
  dysprosium. Can someone send me an atoms input file and tell me how
  to get coordination numbers?

</pre><p>is a <strong>vague, open-ended</strong> question that is unlikely to garner much of
a response.  There are many problems with vague, open-ended questions.
The person asking such a question probably has not spent much time
thinking about or trying to solve the problem.  And it is not clear
how long the person answering will have to spend explaining the
answer.</p>

<p>Remember that the people who answer questions on the mailing list are
volunteering their time.</p>

<p>Most questions about the use of the software will benefit by including
example data or a project file that demonstrates your question.  It is
much easier to answer most questions if the problem can be reproduced
on one's own computer.</p>

<p>For more hints about how to ask good questions <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">&quot;How To Ask Questions The Smart Way&quot;</a> by
Eric Raymond and Rick Moen is very useful.  (Please note that neither
of Raymond, or Moen are associated in any way with Demeter or Ifeffit
nor should they be contacted with questions about Demeter or Ifeffit.)</p>

<h3 id="XAFS_ORG">XAFS.ORG</h3>

<p>The community web site, <a href="http://xafs.org">http://xafs.org</a>, provides a wealth of
information, educational materials, links to other sites of interest
to XAS practitioners, and other community tools. The
<a href="http://xafs.org/Tutorials">tutorials</a>&gt; page contains links to
educational materials written by a number of the luminaries of the XAS
community.  The <a href="http://xafs.org/Workshops">workshops page</a> lists
links to several workshops and schools from recent years.  Many of
those workshops post PDF or PowerPoint files for the lectures given at
the workshop. Go ahead and poke around <a href="http://xafs.org">http://xafs.org</a> -- many of
your questions will be answered.</p>

<p>In November 2011 the Diamond Light Source invited Bruce to do <a href="http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Events/Past_events/XAS-workshop-2011.html?mgnlCK=1339516257183">an XAS training course</a>.
All of the lectures were recorded as was the computer desktop duirng
all lectures and demonstrations.  The Diamond technical staff did a
great job editing this metrial into several hours of streaming video.
These are excellent references for using and understanding the
software.  (<a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/747274">Here is a hint</a> for following
the Microsoft Media Server (mms:) links on that page if you are using
Linux and Firefox.  Presumably, similar solutions exist for other
browsers.)</p>

<p>This is an good overview of XAS: Kelly, S. D., Hesterberg, D. and
Ravel, B. (2008).  Analysis of soils and minerals using X-ray
absorption spectroscopy.  Methods of soil analysis, Part 5
Mineralogical methods. Ulery, A. L. and Drees, L. R. Madison, WI, USA,
Soil Science Society of America: 367-463.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Methods-Soil-Analysis-Part-Mineralogical/dp/0891188460/">(Amazon link)</a></p>

<p>Grant Bunker's recent book, <i>Introduction to XAFS: A Practical Guide
to X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy</i>, is an excellent
resource.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-XAFS-Practical-Absorption-Spectroscopy/dp/052176775X/">(Amazon link)</a></p>

<p>If your question pertains to Feff -- specifically in the area of using
Feff for XANES calculations -- remember that Bruce is but a minor
contributor to Feff and may not in a position to answer your question
authoritatively.  The PI of the Feff project and his team all read
the <a href="http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ifeffit">Ifeffit mailing list</a> and
often answer questions posted there.</p>
