## This pod document is for Demeter version 0.9.22.

=head1 NAME

Installing Demeter from source

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.9.22.

=head1 OVERVIEW

=head2 Installing from packages

Most people will want to install pre-built, ready-to-run packages.

=over 4

=item B<Windows>

Most people installing Demeter on a Windows machine will want to use
the installer and updater packages.  The latest packages can be found
at L<http://bruceravel.github.io/demeter>.

There you will (usually) find two packages.  One is called I<Demeter
Installer for Windows>, the other is called I<Demeter Updater for
Windows>. The updater will have a later version number in its
filename.

The corect procedure is to install the I<Installer> first.  The
I<Updater> will then apply all updates that have come along since the
Installer was posted.

Every updater package is a cumulative updater which incorporates all
changes since the installer package.  Thus only the most recent
updater needs to be applied.

It is B<not> sufficent to simply install the updater.  You must
install the installer package first.

There is B<not> an automated updater for the software.  You must
download the updater and install it yourself.

If the version installed on your computer is smaller than the version
number of the updater but larger or equal to the version number of the
installer, you will only need to download and apply the updater.

=item B<Macintosh OSX>

Frank Schima and Joe Fowler have performed yeoman's duty by making
Demeter and its tool chain available on Macports.


=over 4

=item 1. 

I<Carefully> follow the steps to install Macports: L<http://www.macports.org/install.php>

=item 2.

Open a new Terminal window and type the following. It will take a
while depending on your computer and network speed.

   sudo port install xorg-server demeter-devel

=item 3. 

If this is your first time installing C<xorg-server>, log out and log
back in.  This is needed to set the C<DISPLAY> environment variable.

=back

When it is done, launch Athena by typing the following in
Terminal:

   athena

Note: Make sure you are in a directory you have write permission to
(like your home directory) because hidden files are created at
launch time.

To update a previously installed version of Demeter to the latest,
open a Terminal window and do

   sudo port selfupdate && sudo port upgrade demeter

If you are not using a system-wide MacPorts installation, running
commands as sudo is not necessary.

The Windows installer can be used under emulation.  L<Here are some
notes|http://cars9.uchicago.edu/ifeffit/Demeter/InstallParallels>
from Scott Calvin on doing so using L<Parallels|http://www.parallels.com/>.

If you run into problems, use L<The Ifeffit mailing
list|http://cars9.uchicago.edu/mailman/listinfo/ifeffit/>.  Be as
explicit as possible about the nature of the problem and remember that
saying I<"This is my problem and this what I've tried so far to fix
it"> is much more valuable than just I<"This is my problem.">


=item B<Debian-based or other Linux distributions>

There are no Linux packages yet available because no one has yet
volunteered to do this work.

=back

=head2 Installing source code

The instructions for installing the Demeter source code on a Linux
machine are not trivial, but also not difficult. If you follow these
instructions patiently, everything will work. The main issue is the
large number of dependencies. The instructions on this page should
work on any flavor of Linux, any other Unix, and probably OSX as
well. Everything here except for installing Ifeffit and PGPLOT will
work on a Windows machine with Strawberry perl.

These instructions are for installing system-wide, which requires root
privileges.  All instructions are given assuming that you use a system
which uses L<sudo|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo>.  If your
machine does not use C<sudo>, then replace C<sudo> with C<su -s> in
the instructions that follow.

In a section below (see L<"Installing Demeter without root privileges">)
instructions are given for installation without root privileges.  All
the instructions are the same, once you do an additional preparatory
step.

L<Here is another take on installation instructions|https://gist.github.com/waveform80/3959252>,
written in another person's words.

Demeter is written in perl. B<You must install perl on your
computer>. On Ubuntu, the package name is simply "perl". (My computers
are all Ubuntu, hence all of my hints about packages that need
installing refer to the Ubuntu package names.  Package names on other
systems are likely to be similar.)  You must use at least perl 5.10.
Some "enterprise" versions of Linux (notably Red Hat based ones like
RHEL, CentOS, and Scientific Linux) may ship with an ancient version
of perl.  Demeter will not run under perl 5.6 or 5.8.  You B<will>
have to upgrade perl before using Demeter.

Demeter benefits B<tremendously> by having
L<Gnuplot|http://gnuplot.info> installed. All Linux distributions
should have a package for Gnuplot. On Ubuntu, the package is called
"gnuplot".  You also likely want to install one of the GUI packages,
"gnuplot-x11" or "gnuplot-qt".  Or you can grab the latest source code
from L<Gnuplot's SourceForge
site|http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/> and
install it from scratch.

=head1 BUILD DEMETER AND ITS DEPENDENCIES

=head2 Step 1: Install Ifeffit and PGPLOT

You will need the C<gcc> and C<gfortran> compilers as well as a few
development libraries installed on your computer

=over 4

=item *

Grab the latest Ifeffit source code from I<its git
site|https://github.com/newville/ifeffit>.

=item *

cd into the Ifeffit source directory

=item *

Run the F<PGPLOT_install> script. This streamlines the rather unwieldy
chore of building PGPLOT. This step will require root access to the
computer.

   sudo ./PGPLOT_install

=item *

Do C<./configure>

=item *

Do C<make>

=item *

Do C<sudo make install>

=back

On my Ubuntu machine, the following development libraries are needed
to get Ifeffit and PGPLOT compiled. On other flavors of Linux, these
packages might be called by different names, but hopefully this list
will help you resolve which packages are needed.

=over 4

=item *

C<libx11-dev>

=item *

C<libncurses5>, C<libncurses5-dev>

=item *

C<libpng3>, C<libpng3-dev>

=item *

C<libgif4>

=item *

C<libwxgtk2.8-dev> (the version number, here 2.8, might be different
in your distribution)

=back

=head2 Step 2: Download a copy of Demeter

The source code for Demeter is currently managed on github:
L<https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter>.

To download a copy of the source code, do one of the following:

=over 4

=item *

Use git to clone a copy.  You will need to have
L<git|http://git-scm.com/>, which is a version control system used to
manage the Demeter source code, installed on your computer. On Ubuntu
machines, the package is called "git-core".  At the command line, do:

   git clone https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter.git

then follow along with developments by doing

   git pull

to download future modifications to the code.

=item *

Grab the most recent archive file containing the Demeter source code.
Go to L<https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter> and click on
one of the download buttons near the top of the page to get either the
F<tar.gz> or F<.zip> archive file containing the entire source code.

=back

Cloning a copy with git is far more convenient as it allows you to
keep up more easily as Demeter evolves.

=head2 Step 3: Download and install the dependencies

After checking out a copy of Demeter from git (or unpacking the
archive), cd into the new subdirectory and do

   perl ./Build.PL

If this is the first time you are installing Demeter on this computer,
you will see a very large number of warnings about missing
dependencies. If no warnings are issued, proceed to Step 4.

=head3 Step 3a: Configure cpan (optional)

You will use the L<cpan|https://metacpan.org/module/cpan> program to
download most of the dependencies from L<the CPAN
repository|http://metacpan.org>. You can make this process easier by
configuring the cpan program. Start cpan:

   sudo cpan

At the C<cpanE<gt>> prompt, issue the following commands:

   o conf build_requires_install_policy yes
   o conf prerequisites_policy follow
   o conf commit

Now, when one of Demeter's dependencies itself has a dependency, this
configuration will tell the cpan program to automatically follow them.

Skipping this step is ok, but it means that you will need to answer
"yes" to B<a lot> of questions in Step 3b.

=head3 Step 3b: Install Demeter's dependencies (not optional!)

Now that cpan is correctly configured, do the following

   sudo ./Build installdeps

Go get a cup of coffee. This takes a while.

Although step 3a configures cpan in such a way that most of the
interaction is handled automatically, a few packages will still ask
you questions. Answering yes to all of these questions is a good idea
as these optional dependencies enable some nice features in
Demeter. (However, if you do not have Gnuplot on you computer, answer
"no" to the question about Graphics::GnuplotIF.  But, really, use
Gnuplot.  Your Demeter experience will be much better.)

In my experience, all dependencies install smoothly on recent Linux
installations.  They also all install smoothly under L<Strawberry
Perl|http://strawberryperl.com/> on Windows.  If there are any
failures, you will need to track down the problems and fix them in
order to proceed.

=head3 Step 3c: Dealing with failed dependencies.

Demeter has a lot of dependencies on other Perl modules.  The
C<./Build installdeps> step downloads each of the approximately 40
modules that Demeter needs.  Each of those modules has its own tree of
dependencies.  All in all, a couple hundred packages get downloaded,
built, and installed when do the C<./Build installdeps> step.

Sometimes, a few of these fail.  This is not a disaster.  In most
cases, the problem can be dispatched easily.  See L<this
post|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2015-July/012608.html>
to the Ifeffit Mailing List about some strategies for dealing with
failed builds of dependencies.

L<PDL::Stats> presents a special challange.  There is a L<known
bug|http://sourceforge.net/p/pdl/mailman/pdl-devel/?viewmonth=201505&viewday=12>
in L<PDL::Stats> that is not yet fixed (at the time of this writing,
Aug. 2015) in the upstream source.  If possible, use your system's
pre-built package (the Debian package is called libpdl-stats-perl).

If you cannot use a package and you are unable to build L<PDL::Stats>,
as L<discussed in this mailing list
thread|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2015-August/012679.html>,
do the following:

=over 4

=item 1.

Download PDL::Stats from L<https://metacpan.org/pod/PDL::Stats>

=item 2.

Unpack the tarball and cd into its directory

=item 3.

Copy the file F<glm.patch> from Demeter's F<tools/> directory into the
PDL:Stats top directory

=item 4.

Apply the patch

    patch -p0 < glm.patch

=item 5. Build and install PDL::Stats

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

=back

=head2 Step 4: Build and install Demeter

Almost done! Just do each of the following:

   perl Build.PL
   ./Build
   ./Build test
   sudo ./Build install

You need to redo the C<perl Build.PL> step to verify that all the
dependencies are installed and available. If any failed to install
correctly, you will be told at that stage.

This will put all of Demeter, all the executable programs, and all the
documentation in in the proper place on your computer. You are now
good to go.

The Demeter package now includes components (e.g. L<Xray::Absorption>
and L<STAR::Parser>) that used to be handled separately. Demeter is
now one stop shopping!

If any errors are reported during the C<./Build test> step, you should
report them to Bruce. The best report includes a complete capture of
everything written to the screen. The easiest way to capture screen
text is to use
L<tee|http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/coreutils.html#tee-invocation>.
Here is an example:

   ./Build test | tee screen_messages.txt

=head1 SPECIAL CASES

=head2 Installing Demeter without root privileges

In step 1, replace the command

   ./configure

with

   ./configure --prefix=/path/to/installation/location

Here you need to specify a location in your own disk space in which to
install Ifeffit and all the rest.  I'd recommend something like
C<$HOME/local>.  You will also need to put C<$HOME/local/bin/> in your
execution path, which can be done by adding this to your F<.bashrc> file:

   export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/local/bin/

Even if you are installing Demeter without root, it is probably easier
to get Ifeffit and PGPLOT installed system-wide. On a Debian-based
system, even better would be to install Carlo Segre's pre-built
versions of Ifeffit and PGPLOT by following the instructions at
L<http://debian-xray.iit.edu/>.

Prior to Step 3a, go to L<https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib> and
download the latest version of the L<local::lib> module.  Unpack it
and cd into the newly created directory.  (L<See this mailing list
post|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2014-June/011828.html>
for an explanation of why you want to use L<local::lib>.)

Do

   perl Makefile.PL --bootstrap

Then do

   make test && make install

If you use the bash shell, do

   echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >>~/.bashrc

If you use a shell that uses C shell syntax, follow the instructions
at L<https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib#The-bootstrapping-technique>.

This last step adds a line to your login file. The easiest way for
this to take effect is to log out and log in again or to open a new
terminal window.

Once L<local::lib> is installed, follow all the instructions in Steps
3a, 3b, and 4, except that you now do not need to install using
C<sudo> (that is, type the command as given, but without "sudo").  The
whole point of installing L<local::lib> is to be able to install all
of this software in your own disk space without needing root
privileges.

=head2 Working behind a proxy server

Each of the steps that involves going out onto the big, bad Internet
will require special configuration if you are working from behind a
proxy server.

For example, here at Brookhaven National Laboratory, the proxy URL and
port number is C<http://192.168.1.130:3128>.  In the examples that follow,
you will need to replace that with the correct proxy configuration for
your institution.

=over 4

=item B<git>

To have C<git> talk through the proxy, I had to do this:

   git config --global https.proxy http://192.168.1.130:3128

=item B<cpan>

First, fire up C<cpan> as root

   sudo cpan

At the C<cpanE<gt>> prompt, issue the following commands:

   o conf http_proxy http://192.168.1.130:3128
   o conf ftp_proxy http://192.168.1.130:3128
   o conf commit

=back

C<cpan> should now work properly through the proxy.

=head2 Installing and using source code on Windows

You can easily follow Demeter's developments or hack on Demeter's
source code on a Windows machine. 

=over 4

=item *

Install the most recent Windows installer package from
L<http://bruceravel.github.io/demeter>.

=item *

Next install L<git|http://git-scm.com/> on your computer.

=item *

Proceed with Steps 2 and 4 from the instructions above.  This will
keep you up to date with the latest developments.

=back

=head2 WxPerl GUIs on KDE

WxPerl on linux uses GTK.  This means that the GUIs may not match your
desktop if you are a KDE user.  The solution to this "problem" is to
install the tool for configuring GTK applications under KDE.  On
Ubuntu, this package is called C<kde-config-gtk>.  You will then want
to install the C<gtk2-engines> package.  There are several GTK2 themes
with names like C<gtk2-engines-clearlooks> that you can also install.
The key to making Athena and Artemis look like the rest of your
desktop is to synchronize your choice of KDE and GTK2 themes.  I use
KDE's "cleanlooks" theme with GTK2's "clearlooks" theme.  "Oxygen" is
another possibility.

Upon upgrading to Ubuntu 12.04 on one of my computers, I observed
frequent crashes in Artemis related to drag and drop (e.g. when
importing paths from a Feff calculation).  This turned out to be
related to a problem with the "oxygen-gtk" GTK2 theme.  Changing the
GTK2 theme to any other choice made the problem go away.
