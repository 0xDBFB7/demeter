Seeking help about XAS or about the software

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.9.9.

=head1 OVERVIEW

=head2 Asking questions, soliciting help

An excellent resource exists for anyone stumbling over the details of
XAFS experimentation or analysis -- the  L<Ifeffit mailing
list|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ifeffit>.
This low-noise, high-quality mailing list is populated by many of the
world's expert practitioners of XAS and it handles dozens of questions
every month.  It should be the first place you go when you have a
question about the software or about any other topic in XAS.

Demeter's author, Bruce, reads the mailing list and frequently
responds to questions.  You should send questions to the mailing list
and B<not> to Bruce directly.  Bruce's typical response to an
unsolicited email about the software is a polite request to ask the
same question on the mailing list.

Using the mailing list is in your best interest.  The list gives you
access to a large number of experts and to the entire Ifeffit
community. When you send you question directly to me, you may find me
on travel, in the middle of an experiment, or simply unwilling to read
and write email. When you send mail to the list, you are much more
likely to get a useful answer from someone -- and that someone is
often me. In fact, you may spark a discussion in which your question
will be hashed out in much more detail than you would see in a
response from a single person.

Don't believe me? L<Here is a nice
example|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2011-September/010201.html>
of a question asked which prompted answers from several different
people.  Follow the links that say "next message" to read the various
answers to the question.  After an interesting and useful discussion,
the person with the original question L<had this to
say|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/ifeffit/2011-September/010215.html>.

L<Here is a searchable
archive|http://www.mail-archive.com/ifeffit@millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/>
of the Ifeffit mailing list.  You may find that someone else has
already asked your question.

=head2 How to ask for help

If you are asking for help, I encourage you to ask specific questions
rather than vague ones. For example, 

  I don't understand multiple k-weight fitting. What does it mean to
  use more than one k-weight in a fit and why should I want to do so?

is a B<good> question and is likely to get a detailed answer. On the
other hand,

  I have lots of data from the synchrotron on TiO2 doped with
  dysprosium. Can someone send me an atoms input file and tell me how
  to get coordination numbers?

is a B<vague, open-ended> question that is unlikely to garner much of
a response.  There are many problems with vague, open-ended questions.
The person asking such a question probably has not spent much time
thinking about or trying to solve the problem.  And it is not clear
how long the person answering will have to spend explaining the
answer.

Remember that the people who answer questions on the mailing list are
volunteering their time.

Most questions about the use of the software will benefit by including
example data or a project file that demonstrates your question.  It is
much easier to answer most questions if the problem can be reproduced
on one's own computer.

For more hints about how to ask good questions L<"How To Ask Questions
The Smart Way"|http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html> by
Eric Raymond and Rick Moen is very useful.  (Please note that neither
of Raymond, or Moen are associated in any way with Demeter or Ifeffit
nor should they be contacted with questions about Demeter or Ifeffit.)


=head2 Other XAFS Resources on the Web

=head3 XAFS.ORG

The community web site, L<http://xafs.org>, provides a wealth of
information, educational materials, links to other sites of interest
to XAS practitioners, and other community tools. The
L<tutorials|http://xafs.org/Tutorials>> page contains links to
educational materials written by a number of the luminaries of the XAS
community.  The L<workshops page|http://xafs.org/Workshops> lists
links to several workshops and schools from recent years.  Many of
those workshops post PDF or PowerPoint files for the lectures given at
the workshop. Go ahead and poke around L<http://xafs.org> -- many of
your questions will be answered.

This is an good overview of XAS: Kelly, S. D., Hesterberg, D. and
Ravel, B. (2008).  Analysis of soils and minerals using X-ray
absorption spectroscopy.  Methods of soil analysis, Part 5
Mineralogical methods. Ulery, A. L. and Drees, L. R. Madison, WI, USA,
Soil Science Society of America: 367-463.  L<(Amazon

Grant Bunker's recent book, I<Introduction to XAFS: A Practical Guide
to X-ray Absorption Fine Structure Spectroscopy>, is an excellent
resource.  L<(Amazon

=head3 Ifeffit and Demeter software

You can download Ifeffit from
L<http://cars9.uchicago.edu/iffwiki/Downloads>.  The Demeter installer
for Windows is at L<https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter/downloads>.
General information about Athena, Artemis, and Hephaestus can be found
at L<http://bruceravel.github.com/demeter>, including documentation.

=head3 Feff

If your question pertains to Feff -- specifically in the area of using
Feff for XANES calculations -- remember that Bruce is but a minor
contributor to Feff and may not in a position to answer your question
authoritatively.  The PI of the Feff project and his team all read
the L<Ifeffit mailing
list|http://millenia.cars.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/ifeffit> and
often answer questions posted there.

The Feff homepage is at L<http://leonardo.phys.washington.edu/feff/>.
The Feff9 document, in wiki format, is at
L<http://leonardo.phys.washington.edu/feff/wiki/index.php?title=FEFF_Documentation>.
