## This pod document is for Demeter version 0.9.19.

=head1 NAME

Non-root installation of Demeter on an Ubuntu system

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to Demeter version 0.9.19.

=head1 Demeter Installation

These instructions cover a non-root manual build of L<Bruce Ravel's
Demeter package|https://github.com/bruceravel/demeter> under Ubuntu
12.04. The instructions are deliberately written with a non-technical
audience in mind and hence might read as somewhat patronizing for the
technical reader.  The main 12.04 repositories include fairly recent
versions of most of the pre-requisites, allowing us to simplify the
installation process somewhat.

=head2 First time build

Firstly, start a Terminal. In the sections below I'll represent the terminal
prompt with C<$> -- don't type this when entering commands, it's simply to
give you an indication of what your command line should look like. To save
you typing, you can fairly easily copy and paste examples (excluding the
prompt) by selecting text with your mouse and then middle clicking (the
mouse-wheel on most modern mice) in the terminal where you wish to paste the
selected text.

The first step is to install all the build and runtime dependencies
that are available in the standard Ubuntu repositories, along with
Perl's excellent L<local::lib|https://metacpan.org/module/local::lib>
system which will allow us to play around with the development version
of Demeter without affecting the system Perl install:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential git gfortran \
      gnuplot gnuplot-x11 ifeffit liblocal-lib-perl libx11-dev \
      libncurses5-dev libpng3 libpng3-dev libgif4 libwxgtk2.8-dev

Next, make sure you're in your home directory and use C<local::lib> to
set up a local copy of Perl to play around with in F<~/perl5> (note
that these steps will alter your F<~/.bashrc> file to ensure that
whenever you start a shell in future, it will be using the local copy
of Perl in F<~/perl5>):

    $ cd
    $ echo 'eval $(perl -I$HOME/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib)' >> ~/.bashrc
    $ source ~/.bashrc

Now we configure the Perl environment for building Demeter's
dependencies.  Start the CPAN tool:

    $ cpan

Then, at the CPAN prompt (which looks like C<cpan[1]E<gt>>) enter the
following commands:

    cpan[1]> o conf build_requires_install_policy yes
    cpan[2]> o conf prerequisites_policy follow
    cpan[3]> o conf commit

These simply tell the Perl build environment that we don't want to be endlessly
prompted during the build of all the Demeter pre-requisites. Press Ctrl+D to
quit CPAN and return to the normal terminal prompt. Next, we'll take a clone of
Demeter's git repository:

    $ git clone git://github.com/bruceravel/demeter.git

Now we attempt to build Demeter's dependencies. Firstly, change into the cloned
directory and generate the script to install the dependencies:

    $ cd demeter
    $ perl ./Build.PL

This will probably produce a screen or two of output which, on my
system, looked like this:

    Run 'Build installdeps' to install missing prerequisites.

    Created MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json
    Creating new 'Build' script for 'Demeter' version 'v0.9.19'

The list of the all the C<not installed> items is the list of
dependencies we need to install. We use the generated Build script to
handle installing all these for us:

    $ ./Build installdeps

Be aware that this process will produce a B<very> large amount of terminal
output. This is normal and nothing to be alarmed about (most of the output is
simply the build process giving exhaustive detail of what it's running or
testing or installing at that moment).  However, at times the process will
prompt you to ask whether you want to install something.  Simply hit Enter to
accept the default (which is always "yes") in such instances. The prompts will
look like the following:

    Install Wx? [y ]
    y
    Install Graphics::GnuplotIF? [y ]
    y
    Install File::Monitor::Lite? [y ]
    y
    Install Term::Twiddle? [y ]
    y
    Install Term::Sk? [y ]
    y

These questions may pop up at the start, or after 10 minutes and several
thousand lines of output in the terminal, or both!  Basically, just have
patience and occasionally check your terminal to see if it needs your
confirmation.

During the Wx build you may find small windows appearing randomly on your
desktop. This is part of the test process for the build and perfectly normal.
Try and avoid doing anything with the windows - they should disappear on their
own. Also, if possible, try and avoid using your desktop while this is going
on. The windows may grab keyboard focus, causing you to inadvertently interfere
with the test process if you're typing at the time.

Eventually, the dependencies build should complete. To make sure that all the
dependencies have been installed correctly, re-run the generator script:

    $ perl ./Build.PL

This time you should get output which doesn't include any C<not installed>
items. However, in my particular case for some reason Wx failed to install the
first go round so I got this:

    WARNING: the following files are missing in your kit:
        lib/Demeter/UI/Hephaestus/data/hephaestus.htm
    Please inform the author.

    Checking prerequisites...
      recommends:
        *  Wx is not installed

    ERRORS/WARNINGS FOUND IN PREREQUISITES.  You may wish to install the versions
    of the modules indicated above before proceeding with this installation

    Run 'Build installdeps' to install missing prerequisites.

    Created MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json
    Creating new 'Build' script for 'Demeter' version 'v0.9.19'

Simply re-running the installdeps process fixed this for me (skip this step if
you don't see any C<not installed> items above):

    $ ./Build installdeps

Eventually you should get the following when running Build.PL:

    $ perl ./Build.PL
    WARNING: the following files are missing in your kit:
        lib/Demeter/UI/Hephaestus/data/hephaestus.htm
    Please inform the author.

    Created MYMETA.yml and MYMETA.json
    Creating new 'Build' script for 'Demeter' version 'v0.9.19'

At this point you're finally ready to build and install Demeter itself which
is done as follows:

    $ ./Build
    $ ./Build test
    $ ./Build install

Don't worry if a few errors crop up during the "Build test" phase; you
are building a development copy of the software and inevitably these
are somewhat less stable than "proper" releases.  However, if you do
happen to notice something new has failed since the last time you
tested Demeter, you may want to inform the author.  You can generate a
copy of the test output simply by copying and pasting (as described at
the beginning) or with the following command line which will place the
output in C<test_errors.txt> in your home directory:

    $ ./Build test | tee ~/test_errors.txt

Please ensure when informing the author of any test issues that you
include a copy of the test output, and preferably other details such
as the date on which you last updated your clone of the Demeter
repository (which may help identify the change that caused the
failure) and the version of the OS you're running.

Once "Build install" has completed you should be able to run
applications within the Demeter package as follows:

    $ dathena
    $ dartemis
    $ dhephaestus
    $ denergy

... and so on

=head2 Updating your installation

At some point you may learn that some new feature or existing bug has
been fixed, and wish to update your installation from the latest
development copy.  To do so (you will be relieved to hear!) is
considerably simpler than the initial install.

Firstly, start up a terminal and update your copy of the Demeter
repository:

    $ cd demeter
    $ git pull

Next, ensure that your pre-requisites are still fine (it's possible
that new features may pull in additional pre-requisites):

    $ perl Build.PL

If your output includes any C<not installed> lines you will need to
run the C<installdeps> command line below, but otherwise skip this
step:

    $ ./Build installdeps

Now rebuild, re-test, and re-install Demeter:

    $ ./Build
    $ ./Build test
    $ ./Build install

=head2 Removing your installation

Should you ever wish to start from scratch you can completely remove
your Demeter installation (and the local Perl copy) by starting a
terminal and entering the following commands (be aware these will not
prompt to make sure you really want to delete your installation - they
will simply delete it - hook, line, and sinker):

    $ rm -fr ~/demeter/
    $ rm -fr ~/perl5/
